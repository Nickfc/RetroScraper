In this version the well is 5x5x10 cubes large and the size never changes, unlike the official versions. The controls are somewhat unorthodox, as unlike most other games, the Select button pauses the game while Start speeds up the block so that it moves to the bottom of the well faster. The block designs themselves are the same as in the arcade version of Blockout.",

      "Description": "CONTROL MAN AND BIRD IN A FIGHT FOR THE EIGHT JEWELS OF POWER!\n\nAfter hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again fluorished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet.\n\nThese strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or centers, of the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction...And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!\n\nThe task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the eight Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards.\n\nThen, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return on the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the the eternal gratitude of all mankind!",

Abadox is also known to be difficult, since it takes one hit from an enemy projectile to be killed. In Abadox, if a player is killed, one must restart from a checkpoint passed before death.",

The game is a platformer with a wacky storyline in which the eponymous main character explored multiple planets and fought enemies while jumping through levels. The game was notable for the planet Turvia, where gravity works in reverse. In that level the protagonist was drawn upside down, as were the enemies and the entire screen. The main character has a comically large head and strongly resembles actor Bruce Campbell. His early game attack consists of a sort of a lightsaber.",

      "Storyline": "The story is that in the far future, humans colonized many planets and established a form a biotechnology, which were sentient beings called Compuminds, which could communicate rapidly from world to world. The game's villain had shut down all the Compuminds and hid them. Eventually one of the Compuminds, named Kakos, was found. Rad Gravity is the name of the game's hero. Together, Rad and Kakos must find the eight missing Compuminds, each on eight different unique planets, such as the cyberpunk world of Cyberia, the green jungle world of Sauria, and the caustic trash world of Effluvia.",

Like the creatures in the later movie Independence Day, the Fortresses behave like interstellar locusts, consuming all of the resources and living things in their path. The Space Federation sends their mightiest fleet, but they are quickly eliminated by the powerful Fortresses. In a final gambit, they send a single warrior (Hal Bailman), outfitted with a shielded spacesuit, powerful weapons, and small lightship to infiltrate the Fortresses and destroy them from the inside out.",

      "Description": "\"Now you're really in trouble\" said the evil Wizard. \"I'm turning you into a ball of air and sending you into my mansion, with over 250 rooms, to search for the Spellbook that may give you the clues on how to transform yourself into a human again. It's not as easy as it sounds, for you, as the ball of air, have a slow leak, and you'll need to jump on an air pump in some rooms to remain inflated. Take heed, for if you pump up too much you will burst! If you are lucky enough to find the book in these rooms, you'll next have to pick up the objects I've left, such as: crosses, tins of beans, a Buddha, a dragon statue, a pumpkin, a flask, and even crates that you'll need to get over treacherous obstacles! This is your one chance for survival,\" he cackles.\n\n\"Sounds easy\" you laughingly boast to the evil Wizard.\n\n\"Oh, does it now?\" he sneers. \"Well, I'm also putting spikes in these rooms that will take your breath away, as well as killer pads on the floor. You have no chance for success... Hee! Hee! Hee!\"",

Those nasty seals have tusks as sharp as blades. If you can't crush them with a block of ice I suggest you dive out of their way.\nHang on! This is only round No. 1. Now let's try getting through to round No. 50. If you manage to get through all of that, how about constructing your own personal custom-tailored round. Good luck!",

      "Description": "The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game. The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety. By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.",

      "Description": "Arkista's Ring is a game developed by American Sammy for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. It utilizes the familiar top-down perspective featured in many action-adventure games, such as The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Shining Force. What sets it apart is the linear style of the game, as well as the limitation of one primary character. Interestingly, Arkista's Ring is an example of an early game with a female protagonist-an elf named Christine. The game is now considered to be a particularly rare NES title.",

The game consists of six linear levels of which each has two sub-levels meaning the game consists of 12 level in total. After every level there is a cut-scene pushing the story forward.\n\nThere are three weapons - an axe, a spear and a big sword. An axe is a basic weapon the hero holds at the beginning of the game. The player can upgrade the axe using a power-up which has the shape of a small axe. The spear is the second stage of the weapon upgrade system and the big sword is the final stage. The big sword is the most powerful melee weapon in the game.\n\nThe player can cast three magic spells which using is limited by the magic meter. The first is \"Bind\", which stops the time altogether with the enemies in the level. The second is \"Blast\", which casts fire balls destroying all enemies visible on the screen at the time of the casting. The third is \"Bolt\", which has the form of a lightning strike and acts similarly to \"Blast\".",

Athletic World was developed by Bandai in 1986, and released for the Nintendo System using the Family Fun Fitness pad. It was marketed as a fun way to engage in exercise and physical fitness. The game was originally released in a box that featured the Family Fun Fitness logo. When Nintendo later purchased the rights to the FFF pad, the game was re-released with a different label-featuring the Athletic World name. This has made the original release a collector's item, and fairly rare.",

The game kept track of what teams had been defeated by giving the player a password at the end of each victory, which could be entered into the game to return to the spot where the player was. The game also kept track of the pitcher's stamina, which meant that some rotation was necessary throughout the different games.",

It was created specifically as an attempt to entice more girls to play video games, and was one of the very few Nintendo Entertainment System games with girl-oriented themes. It was not a particularly well-received game at the time, but has received some recognition for having some quality puzzles and gameplay style. Others have criticized it for being an example of \"pink\" software; which refers to software that was designed for male audiences that is re-skinned for female gamers, without taking into account true female gamer preferences.",

      "Storyline": "Baseball Stars, due to the introduction of a battery backup, allowed players to create a team and season which could be stored, so that statistics were retained between playing sessions. Players were able to create players and teams, even going so far as naming these elements. As well, the game introduced managerial controls, such as the ability to earn money, gain prestige, and upgrade players on the roster. David Littman, a producer on EA's NHL series of games, has said that the popular GM mode in the NHL games was inspired by Baseball Stars, so the influence it has has continued.\nGameplay involved taking part in a season, or simply a one-off versus mode. The rules of the game stayed true to baseball, and the realism was seen as being far beyond anything that had come prior to its release.",

      "Description": "Baseball Stars 2 is a 2-player baseball arcade game released by SNK in 1992 for the Neo-Geo console. A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year. Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992. Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form. Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players. Enhanced pitch control. Ability to shift field formations when playing defense. Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game. Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired. Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.) Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting. Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each. New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation. Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams. You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5. Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum. You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name. Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in \"View Team\" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)",

Gigantic spiders, sneaky ants and loathsome slugs are just a few of the meanies who'll get in your way when you're bee number 52. You're hardly defenseless though, and with enough speed, skill and firepower you may get through the day - despite being heavily outnumbered. Let your nose, or rather proboscis, lead the way to the flowers and don't let anyone - or anything - get in your way! B52 - you're cleared for take off!\n\nBee 52 is a side-scrolling video game published by Codemasters for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992.\n\nA Commodore 64 version was completed in 1993, but was not published due to Codemasters withdrawing from the C64 market. After reaching an agreement with Codemasters, the programmer sold the game himself via mail order.",

The game is played through 12 levels, the first four in a backyard, the next four in a swamp, and the last four inside a house. There are traps and enemies added for each level, from ants, grasshoppers, and even dragonflies and \"venus flytraps\" in the later levels. The player must find and collect from many flowers scattered all over the sidescrolling level and return to the hive after three flowers are visited to add honey to the jar. The level is complete when the jar is full, in the case of levels 3-12, this requires every flower to be visited.",

Although the initial levels of the game are based upon the film, with Beetlejuice venturing through the Maitland House to find and scare away Otho, the later levels are original and involve Beetlejuice fighting mythical creatures in such locations as a sewer system and the afterlife.",

      "Description": "Bible Buffet is an unlicensed game created by Wisdom Tree for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a single player or multiplayer game. The primary goal is to stop the oil drums and the silverware whose goal is to kill the player.\nSimilar to Candy Land, this game has the player spin a spinner to move a specified amount of spaces told by the spinner to move. The regular space is the player's own space, red space indicates another spin, a red circle connected to another red circle has the player move one step forward or backward. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, the player can take a pop quiz of three trivia questions and then, if succeeded, gets to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one-four spaces, along with the prize of winning a star. If the player lands on the happy face, something rewarding happens such as moving ahead ten spaces, getting a key, heart etc. If the sad face is landed on, something unrewarding happens, including a loss of a turn, moving back a space, etc. At the end of the game, a bonus is awarded to the player who got to the end first and/or got the most pop quiz stars aside collecting the most food. After that, the entire amount of points is shown to each player.",

Along the way, Big Nose collects bones, that he can use to buy items from the various shops that include spells, upgrades to his abilities and items.\n\nThis game is also very difficult because you cannot restart from where you left off once all your lives are gone. It is also very long with four islands (Paradise Island, Monster Island, Terror Island, and Chaos Island) each containing several levels. Big Nose the Caveman dies in a single hit unless he has stones. The stones can shoot out of his club, killing enemies. As many as three stones can come out of the club. There are also many pitfalls, traps and deadly lava/water since Big Nose can't swim.\nIt was followed by a sequel in 1992.\n\nA Master System and Game Gear version called Dinobasher was completed, but never published.",

      "Description": "Do you have racing in your blood and ice in your veins.\n\nKonami introduces the only NASCAR endorsed stock car simulation that turns your disk drive into a pit pass to the most authentic racing environment available. Co-designed by Winston Cup Champion Bill Elliott and Distinctive Software- developed or Test Drive and The Duel- this is a test of your mettle and milliseconds on the banked ovals of six official, perfectly scaled NASCAR tracks like Daytona, Talladega, Bristol, Darlington, Michigan and Atlanta. Or the two twisting road courses of Sears Point or Watkins Glen. All with bit map graphics plus a scaling technique, creating graphics so detailed you can actually read the car's make when you go bumper to bumper.\n\nOn-screen statistics tell you course length, maximum banking and the total number of laps in each race. With this vital data, adapt your car to each unique track by adjusting gear ratio, transmission, spoiler angle and tire stagger. Depending on whether you're racing or qualifying for pole position, you must also decide which type of engine to use. But \"dial in\" your car carefully. One miscalculation could send you reeling into the wall.\n\nWhen you think you have the right stuff, drop the hammer on NASCAR's finest field of racers- including Bill Elliott himself- in single races or compete for the Cup in the Championship Season.",

The arm also grabs opponents and pulls them towards the player character.",

In this version the well is 5x5x10 cubes large and the size never changes, unlike the official versions. The controls are somewhat unorthodox, as unlike most other games, the Select button pauses the game while Start speeds up the block so that it moves to the bottom of the well faster. The block designs themselves are the same as in the arcade version of Blockout.",

Bomberman found it to be an unbearably dreary existence. One day, he heard an encouraging rumor. According to the rumor, any robot that could escape the underground compound and make it to the surface could become human. Bomberman leaped at the opportunity, but escape proved to be no small task. Alerted to Bomberman's betrayal, large numbers of the enemy set out in pursuit. Bomberman can rely only on bombs of his own production for his defense. Will he ever make it up to the surface? Once there, will he really become human?",

With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.",

For thousands of years, their vast mental capabilities have been focused upon one goal: the conquest of the universe! To accomplish this, they are creating huge armies of robo-mutants - bizarre creatures, half robot and half living flesh. With their seven manufacturing bases producing thousands of robo-mutants each day, the Burai armies will soon overrun the galaxy - unless you can stop them! Strap on your proton pack, charge up your laser cannon, and prepare to do battle with the deadliest army of mutant rogues in the universe. You must somehow penetrate the seven bases of the Burai, where you will confront a super-mutant guarding each base - monstrous creatures like the Giganticrab, Jawsipede, and Fangskull - until finally, you face the terrifying Slimedragon! But with the awesome arsenal of weapons at your command, victory may still be within your reach. It's up to you to rid the universe of the evil Burai once and for all!",

The player walk, jump, climb on vines, moonwalk (by pressing the \"select\" button) and shoot an unlimited supply of grape jelly beans as projectiles. As was the case with other Capcom games, such as Mega Man and DuckTales, one can play the first four levels in any order that you want, but the final level is only available after you have collected the musical notes from each of the four levels.\n\nThe first four levels include The Grape Vine, The Factory, The Maize Maze and The Juicery. The final level takes places in The Clouds. During each level you can collect 'I' icons that give you temporary invincibility, regular black musical notes for bonus points, 'Sunshine' icons to restore your health, and 'Raisinette' icons to give an extra life to the player. One can also locate items by shooting at the thin air or at columns.",

Scientists, during the course of the game, are working on a top-secret Neutron Cannon. During several missions, the player must make supply drops to the scientists working underground.

In Casino Kid 2, the Casino Kid, after having defeated the top players in Las Vegas, is issued a challenge by the top gamblers around the world. The matches are organized by a mysterious leader and to unveil the leader, the Casino Kid must defeat nine opponents from around the world in the games of roulette, poker and blackjack.

      "Description": "You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.\n\nYou make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.\n\nThe game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.\n\nTowers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.",

The game was often considered frustrating for its length and lack of a save or password system. Phfax, a mystic being and wielder of the Emerald Magic, consented to offer his life to protect the stones of Rune. For centuries he dwelled within the plasma of energies of the stones where the Runes were hidden. Until at last it drove him insane. Such was the power of the stone that even the bitter hallucinations of his madness were given life. Six deadly beings appeared stealing the Rune Stones. You, Cebo, the most promising of the young Magicians of Dace, must enter the castle, exploring the realities. But do not trust your senses - what you see, what you hear may all be a lie!",

Well think again, 'cause according to a damsel in distress, evil Count Dracula has left a horrifying curse in his wake. And the only hope you have of ending the terror is to destroy his missing body parts! Talk about your frightening quest, searching a maze of mansions, graveyards and dark, eerie forests - each guarded by man-eating werewolves, fire-throwing zombies and other devilish demons. Your grim chances are kept alive in Transylvania, where cowardly villagers offer clues to the whereabouts of Dracula's remains. And where you'll purchase magic weapons, including silver knives and flame whips. But beware the night. For when the sun disappears, Dracula's curse grows deadlier. And your chances grow dimmer and dimmer.",

      "Description": "Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is poised to bury mankind in a Tomb of Terror. Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosomes. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!",

In 1996, however, 1,500 copies of the game were located in a warehouse, and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges, some with a small gold sticker reading \"Cheetamen II\". This cartridge is now very rare and hard to find, though numerous ROM images exist on the Internet.\n\nIn Cheetahmen II the player again assumes the role of one of the three Cheetahmen (Aries, Apollo and Hercules); after defeating a boss at the end of the second level, they switch to the next Cheetahman for the following two levels, as in the Action 52 version. Due to a bug, it is impossible to get to the levels in which one plays Cheetahman Aries without altering the ROM image or experiencing a glitch that very rarely starts the game on these two levels.",

Despite being an unlicensed port, the game followed several official examples by being censored with some nudity covered up.\n\nIn the game, you are in various medieval settings, usually featuring innocent people restrained in torture devices.

As Gadget goes on ahead to scout the area and Monterey Jack is sent to investigate sightings of strange mechanical dogs with Zipper, Chip and Dale proceed through the streets and into a laboratory, where they are attacked by a crazed robot.\n\nAfter defeating the robot, Fat Cat appears and reveals that \"Mandy's kitten\" was just a distraction so he could kidnap Gadget and force her to work for him. Fortunately, Gadget is able to contact Chip and Dale by building a wireless phone and sending a map to them via carrier pigeon, allowing them to navigate through the treacherous landscape and reach Fat Cat's casino where she is being held. After rescuing her, Gadget provides the chipmunks with a rocket that sends them towards Fat Cat's hideout so they can defeat him.",

At once, Chip, Dale, Gadget, Monterey Jack, and Zipper set off to defuse the explosive before it goes off. While there, they manage to corner the rabbit responsible for setting the bomb, who admits that it was Fat Cat who ordered him to do it (having broken out of prison the night before) so he can steal a relic called the Urn of the Pharaoh from a docked cargo ship.\n\nThe Rangers give chase to the docks. After a search of the ship turns up nothing, Zipper then spots Fat Cat running into a warehouse. Chip and Dale follow him inside, but are ambushed and locked in a refrigerator to freeze. Though the chipmunks escape in time, Fat Cat opens the Urn and releases the evil spirits contained within it.",

      "Description": "Play the game of your dreams with Top Players' Tennis - the only game where you \"become\" Ivan Lendl or Chris Evert.\n\nBut first, you've got four major tournaments to play; the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Play singles against a friend, or the computer; double up with Lendl or Evert to beat the computer; or play with a friend against the computer. There's excitement, action and sweat as you play game... set... match - and win!\n\nTop Players' Tennis gives you total command of the ball. Hit a passing shot cross-court or down-the-line; play deep from the baseline; serve and volley or take the game with an overhead smash. You set the speed of the serve and the spin on the ball, giving it a top spin, slice, drop shot or side spin - just like the pros. When you're ready, hit a \"Miracle shot,\" where the ball can zig-zag or soar right up in the air!\n\nWhile you play, Evert and Lendl are by your side, with adviCe at the touch of a button. So put yourself on the court with a pro. With Top Players' Tennis, the only thing between you and the Grand Slam is...you!",

The player start out in the game with little life and few weapons, but he can collect various icons to increase how many direct hits that he can withstand, keys to open doors, along with various circus items to shoot as projectiles.\nMany of the levels can be avoided altogether by just walking backwards and back through the curtain from where the player begins. This will take him right to that level's boss battle.\nBonus levels include such fun things as guiding a bear to jump over flames, avoiding boulders in a car, using Rodan as target practice and meeting Godzilla at the circus grounds.",

The object of the game is to drive through a series of cities and paint every part of the roads in each city as proof of your visit to that city. City Connection was remarkable for its time in that each location had its own background and music which was a variation on the main theme of the game. There are twelve locations: Manhattan, the Grand Canyon, Easter Island, Paris, Neuschwanstein Castle, London, Sydney, Egyptian temples, and cities in India, Holland, China and Japan.",

Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated opponent. The answer to the puzzle is hidden by tiles. The tiles have words denoting game prizes (\"Mexico\", \"Camera\", \"Telescope\", for example) and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered over again. As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed. Solve the puzzle and you win the game.",

      "Description": "Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches.\n\nEnemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.\n\nThe plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.",

      "Description": "Crackout is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Konami in 1991. It is based upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s. The object of the game is to clear levels by either destroying all bricks or defeating the enemies.\nThere are four zones of eleven levels each. The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of \"Konami Man\", who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning. If the player input the password correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from the game. The password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.",

      "Description": "Theodore \"Todd\" Thornley IV has had enough. After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff \"Crash\" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.",

      "Description": "Cyberball is an Atari Games arcade game of 7-man American football, using robotic avatars of different speeds, sizes, and skill sets. The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from \"cool\" to \"warm\", \"hot\", and \"critical\" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to \"cool\" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play.",

To succeed the player must press the pads with their feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.",

      "Description": "Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum was an action game for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1990 exclusively in North America. Players take the role of Dash Galaxy, a space scout who has been captured by a hostile civilization. Gameplay involves a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors and, eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to completing the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies. While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have a overhead view and include more difficult block-moving puzzles which can fatally trap a player.",

Their attempts at creating computer intelligence has backfired, as the AI they've created has taken over the computer systems and is threatening the world! Deep in the fortress is a gamma bomb, and your goal is to penetrate the fortress to destroy the bomb before it can be used. But be careful, for many Deathbots are guarding the maze-like passageways leading to the bomb!\n\nGameplay is from an overhead point of view; you'll need to find your way through the various passageways to reach the gamma bomb (located on the 8th level) and diffuse it. In addition to doorways and walls, transporters can also be found in the maze. These will instantly teleport you to a new location, and on many levels you will need to figure how to use them correctly to get past otherwise dead ends. Different types of Deathbots guard the passages; and you'll need to use the various weapons you find lying about to get past them, before they destroy you. You have a limited amount of energy. Each time you are hit by enemy fire or by a Deathbot, your energy depletes. Lose all of of your energy and a life is lost. And of course, each level ends with a large boss Deathbot. Good luck on your mission!",

      "Description": "The player's force consists of nine different types of units and one headquarters unit (which is a unit by itself and also can be used to attack). Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types.",

      "Description": "Devil World is a maze video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan on October 5, 1984 and in Europe on July 15, 1987. The game was also released on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on January 22, 2008 and in Europe and Australia on October 31, 2008. The game has similar gameplay to that of Pac-Man. It is the only game designed by Shigeru Miyamoto that has not been released in North America, despite the fact that the game is simple and in English. This was due to Nintendo of America's strict policies on the use of religious icons in games, which were at their strictest level at the time of the game's original release, but there would eventually be a North American release for the first time in October 2023 as part of the Nintendo Switch Online lineup.",

      "Description": "Dino Hockey was originally planned for a release by SunSoft. One of the things that makes this game unique, is that there is an extremely limited amount of information about the game. All that is really known about the game, is that there was a mention of the game in the September, 1991 issue of Gamepro magazine, during their writeup of the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. With that in mind, it was more than likely presented at the show. However, there had never been any screenshots of the game in any publication or public medium up to this point. So it’s quite a rare title already, with very little documentation noted.",

      "Description": "Dirty Harry is based on the popular Clint Eastwood movie character of \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan (rather than the specific movie \"Dirty Harry\"), a cop famous for his use of a .44 magnum for doing away with evildoers, and for his catchphrase, \"Go ahead, make my day.\" In fact, the game begins with a digitized sample of that quote. The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.",

So off went Daisy to get some cherries from her cupboard and there were none to be seen! \"Pogie's pinched the cherries!\" she cried, as she saw Pogie's pawprint in the cupboard. \"That darned fluffle. Come here you!\" and Pogie promptly darted off into the enchanted forest to escape Daisy's rage. Dizzy and Daisy decided to go into the forest to catch Pogie and gather some more cherries at the same time. Whilst searching for Pogie they got lost and found a castle, where they thought they would find help, but it seemed deserted. They looked in the castle for Pogie, but Daisy caught herself on a mystic spinning wheel. She started feeling really sleepy, so she found a bed and went to sleep. \"Wake up Daisy, wake up!\" shouted Dizzy. But before he could wake her up, Rockwart the troll caught him and locked him up in an underground prison! Now Dizzy must escape, wake up Daisy from her enchanted sleep, defeat Rockwart, and find the cherries along the way.",

      "Description": "The game features one and two player modes, both of which are single screen. In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\nIn the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Junior; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challanging, not only the goal is a negative number, but giving players the set number.",

The entire graphical style is more in line with Technōs’ Kunio-kun series, with characters that go for exaggerated expression rather than gritty realism.\n\nThe biggest change, however, was reserved for the moveset. You start the game with only the punch, kick and headbutt available – all the other moves are obtained via an RPG-lite style experience system. Hitting enemies is now rewarded with a certain amount of experience points depending on the attack, and each time the counter goes above 999, you’re awarded an additional heart, which extends the range of possible actions. Two hearts add the uppercut and roundhouse kick combo finishers, and with three Billy can perform the jump kick maneuver. The fourth heart unlocks access to grappling moves.",

      "Description": "Technōs created once again a vastly different experience with Double Dragon II on the NES. The experience system was dropped, but the moveset still underwent a few changes. The elbow attack and turning jump kick are gone, but with the standard kick directed backwards they seemed a bit redundant anyway. There are two new ways to make enemies in a grapple suffer, elbow smashes to the head, and a high kick to propel them away. In the brief time window when the Lee brothers are crouching after a jump or after getting knocked down, it’s possible to perform a rising uppercut or a knee jump attack. The timing for these isn’t easy, but they are the most powerful moves in the game.\n\nOn the NES, Double Dragon II is a much more innovative and unique sequel than in the arcade, but it marks also the time Double Dragon started its schizophrenic shifting between wildly different tones and gameplay styles. In a way it’s one of the best games to bear the Double Dragon name, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that Technōs had already started to loose a cohesive vision of what it meant to be Double Dragon, both in tone and in gameplay.",

There is a menu which has four options, open, get, go, and hit. There are 11 Warp Zones in all. At the end of each of the first 10 Warp Zones, Michael must fight a large monster that carries a piece of the Laser and guards a valuable piece of equipment, the latter consisting of the Ultra Space Sensor, four Life Bottles, the Air Helmet, the Jump Boots, two Blue Vitamins and the Shield Suit. Once Michael fully assembles the Laser, he'll be able to challenge the final boss, Canbarian.",

      "Storyline": "Dr. Jekyll is on his way to his wedding with the lovely Miss Millicent. As he walks to the church with his cane in hand, several townspeople, animals, and other obstacles accost him, causing him to become angry. If his anger reaches a certain level, he transforms into Mr. Hyde and is taken to a nightmarish world of monsters. As Mr. Hyde kills these monsters, his anger abates and eventually he transforms back into Dr. Jekyll.\n\nThere are two endings to the game. The normal ending occurs when Dr. Jekyll reaches the church at the end of the sixth level. Dr. Jekyll weds Miss Millicent and 'END' is displayed with the wedding march playing in the background. The alternative ending occurs when Mr. Hyde reaches the church. In this case, a boss named Letule appears. After defeating the boss, Mr. Hyde transforms back into Dr. Jekyll. A more detailed scene of the wedding is shown with Dr. Jekyll kissing Miss Millicent. The screen fades with 'END' displayed, and lightning strikes a few moments later. A silhouette of what appears to be Mr. Hyde with a cross inserted into his back appears.",

      "Description": "Dr. Mario is a falling block tile-matching video game, in which Mario assumes the role of a doctor, dropping two-colored medical capsules into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it falls, moving it left or right and rotating it such that it is positioned alongside the viruses and any existing capsules. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck.",

Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).\n\nThis port also has less stages than the original game.",

      "Description": "Though not the first role-playing game developed by a Japanese company, Dragon Warrior is considered one of the progenitors of the Japanese RPG genre, and the first to appear on a home console. The player navigates a lone pre-made protagonist on a top-down overworld, accessing locations represented by icons, similarly to early Ultima games. As opposed to most other RPGs of the time, dungeons are viewed from an overhead perspective as well. In cities and palaces it is possible to talk to people, rest in inns and buy weapons, armor and items in shops.\n\nWhen wandering around in the wilderness or through dungeons, the player character encounters randomly appearing enemies. Combat is turn-based, with the player selecting menu options while fighting. It is possible to attack with the equipped weapon, cast one of the few available spells (using up some of the magic energy), use an item, or try to run. All the battles in the game are exclusively one-on-one. Killing monsters yields experience, and the player character's attributes improve automatically when he levels up.\n\nWith the exception of the final location, the entire game world is theoretically open for exploration from the beginning. However, the enemies become increasingly tough as the player character attempts to move away from the starting town, effectively limiting him to confined areas determined by his level. The hero has limited hit points, loses them when attacked by enemies, and dies when he runs out of them, at which point he is automatically restored in a nearby town. It is possible to save the game only by talking to the king in the initial castle.",

However, a man who could tame dragons and hence known as a Dragonlord, became corrupted by his magical studies. He attacked the Tantegel Castle and stole the Balls of Light, causing monsters to roam the land. A valiant hero named Erdrick, who had obtained the Balls of Light for the kingdom in the first place, attempted to defeat the Dragonlord and disappeared without trace. Many years later, during the reign of King Lorik XVI, the Dragonlord abducted Princess Gwaelin, carrying her to Castle Charlock. One day, a knight appears in front of the king, claiming to the be the descendant of Erdrick. He is entrusted with the mission to vanquish the Dragonlord, as the prophet Mahetta has predicted.",

During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.\n\nThe game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.",

They knew it had to be a first-rate story with sophisticated graphics. The result was Dragon Wars.\n\nSailing across uncharted seas, you and your party are in search of a legendary paradise called Dilmun — a place where the streets are paved with gold and no one wants for anything.\n\nHowever, King Drake of Phoebus has declared all magic illegal - magickers have been slain or fled into exile. In retaliation, enemy islands have threatened to unleash their guardian dragons, the most destructive force in the world. While docked at a harbor in Dilmun, you are arrested on suspicion of spellcasting.\n\nImprisoned and stripped of everything but your wits, you are sentenced to life in a cesspool called Purgatory. Magic is your only salvation - a worldly possession in a world possessed.",

      "Description": "Dragon's Lair is a side-scrolling platform game based on the laserdisc game of the same name released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and developed by the MotiveTime group. Plotwise, the game is identical to the original.\n\nThe game is a side-scroller with the character walking slowly. Dirk can walk, crawl, or jump forward, and he has an array of weapons that he can discover and use to dispose of enemies. The controller layout is reversed from other mainstream NES titles, with Select functioning as the Pause-button while Start is used for the Candle object (which helps reveal hidden weapons). Also, B is used for jumping, and A for attacking (the input of the A & B buttons is almost always the opposite in similar NES games).\n\nTwo different versions were released later, first for the Famicom, with major improvements on playability and speed, and a second one for PAL regions, expanding upon the Famicom version with new enemies and cutscenes.",

The story involves Scrooge McDuck traveling around the globe collecting treasure and outwitting his rival Flintheart Glomgold to become the world's richest duck.\n\nProduced by key personnel from the Mega Man series, DuckTales would go on to sell over a million copies worldwide on each system, becoming Capcom's best-selling title for both platforms. The game was praised for its tight control, unique and non-linear gameplay and bright presentation, and is often regarded as one of the best titles for the NES, appearing on numerous \"Best of\" lists.",

      "Storyline": "The Beagle Boys attempt another raid on Scrooge's money bin, with Baggy, Burger and Bouncer Beagle capturing Huey, Dewey and Louie. After Scrooge rescues them, he finds Big Time Beagle in his office with a painting in his hands. With the help of Duckworth, Big Time is defeated and retreats. The painting reveals the locations of five treasures, and Scrooge wastes no time to set out for them. Scrooge and Launchpad visit the Amazon to find the Sceptre of the Incan King. Using eight golden coins, they uncover the hidden temple of Manco Capquack, but the sceptre is lost and the temple is destroyed by its guardian statue. The chief of the natives then approaches Scrooge and Launchpad and thanks them for returning their city to them, and gives Scrooge the recovered sceptre in return, which was just the king's back scratcher. Scrooge, the nephews and Webby visit the castle of Drake Von Vladstone, also known as Dracula Duck, who was the heir to the Coin of the Lost Realm. The boys fall into a trap door and are spread throughout the Transylvanian mansion, but Scrooge saves them from the Beagle Boys, disguised as ghosts. Each of the beagle boys were also carrying a torn sheet of paper which contained part of a riddle. They uncover a mirror where Scrooge solves the riddle, and Magica De Spell reveals herself, who is also after the coin. Scrooge and Magica then face off for it, and the sorceress is defeated and retreats empty-handed. Scrooge and the nephews travel to the African Mines to find the Giant Diamond of the Inner Earth, but they find the workers are being scared off by voices and earthquakes, claiming the mine is haunted. Deep underground, Scrooge discovers that the Terra-Firmians and their games are the cause, and after interfering he is attacked by their king. Defeated, the king makes an agreement with Scrooge to stop the games in exchange for the mining operations to continue, as it will rid them of the diamonds they consider to be \"garbage rocks\". He gives Scrooge the Giant Diamond of the Inner Earth to start with.",

Inspired to discover the hidden treasure left by Fergus, Scrooge starts an expedition to find the missing pieces, unaware that his archenemy Flintheart Glomgold is also after the lost treasure of McDuck.\n\nScrooge travels to Niagara Falls, a pirate ship in the Bermuda Triangle, Mu, Egypt and Scotland. Each area has its own unique treasure that is guarded by a boss. After all five main stages are cleared, Webby is kidnapped by Glomgold and held for ransom on the pirate ship in the Bermuda Triangle. Scrooge arrives and gives Glomgold the treasures, only to discover that this \"Glomgold\" is actually a shapeshifting robot called the D-1000 programmed to destroy him. After the D-1000 is defeated, Glomgold sinks the ship and tries to take Scrooge and the treasures with it.",

      "Description": "500 years ago, the Kingdom of Granville fought a terrible war with Darces the Dark Overlord. A great hero, the warrior \"Magi\", rose to challenge Darces. He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, \"Tores\", used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land. According to an old saying, \"When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun, the Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five.\"",

Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses. Eliminator Boat Duel has 24 unique race courses.",

      "Description": "Elite is a space trading video game, written and developed by David Braben and Ian Bell and originally published by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers in September 1984.Elite's open-ended game model, and revolutionary 3D graphics led to it being ported to virtually every contemporary home computer system, and earned it a place as a classic and a genre maker in gaming history. The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of \"Elite\".\n\nElite was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden line removal. It added graphics and twitch gameplay aspects to the genre established by the 1974 game Star Trader. Another novelty was the inclusion of The Dark Wheel, a novella by Robert Holdstock which gave players insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire.",

The goal is to conquer Europe. The game begins with Napoleon as an army officer, but with victories in combat, the user may get promoted to Commander-in-Chief, First Consul, and finally Emperor of the French, with more powers and actions available at each level. As Emperor, the user also controls Napoleon's brothers, Louis, Jérôme, Lucien, and Joseph, as well as Napoleon's stepson, Eugene Beauharnais. The game has both military and civilian aspects. The user can lead armies, act as mayor of cities, and depending on the level achieved, engage in diplomacy with other nations. This historically accurate game reproduces many historical figures and the militaries of Europe with great detail.",

      "Description": "Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land is an unlicensed NES game made by Wisdom Tree in 1991.\nAccording to the game's instruction manual, the player controls the biblical figure Moses as he leads the Israelites to the promised land. Moses has the ability to shoot glowing \"W's\", which signify the word of God, to defeat enemies and remove obstacles. To finish each level, Moses must acquire five question marks as well as a certain amount of manna while avoiding enemies such as magicians and soldiers. After a level is completed, the player must answer five bible-related questions before advancing to the next level. Exodus, like many Wisdom Tree games, is a rehashed version of a Color Dreams game, in this case Crystal Mines.",

      "Description": "Slice through the dark and own the night in your Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, the first operational aircraft to utilize stealth technology in its design. This isn’t your typical attack fighter, you’ll be flying sorties under the cover of night, avoiding detection by enemy radar and striking high-value targets with precision weaponry. You’ll want to haunt the battlefield like a ghost, menacing the enemy with earth-shattering ordnance before vanishing in your airborne apparition as suddenly as you appeared.\n\nWith a hardcore devotion to authenticity, F-117A brings you unprecedented night combat action. You’ll go through every phase of mission planning, from requesting a specific assignment during briefing to choosing your own munitions during armament, before then climbing into your cockpit and experiencing the thrill of dropping 1,000 lbs. of laser-guided destruction on enemy troops, tanks and bunkers. This is your chance to fly one of the most technologically impressive warplanes ever made.",

The game begins when he approaches Eolis, his hometown, after an absence to find it in disrepair and virtually abandoned. Worse still, the town is under attack by Dwarves.The Elven king explains that the Elf fountain water, their life source, has stopped and provides the protagonist with 1500 golds, the games currency, to prepare for his journey to uncover the cause.As the story unfolds, it is revealed that Elves and Dwarfs lived in harmony among the World Tree until The Evil One emerged from a fallen meteorite. The Evil One then transformed the Dwarves into monsters against their will and set them against the Elves. The Dwarf King, Grieve, swallowed his magical sword before he was transformed, hiding it in his own body to prevent The Evil One from acquiring it. It is only with this sword that The Evil One can be destroyed.His journey takes him to four overworld areas: The tree's buttress, the inside of the trunk, the tree's branches and finally the Dwarves' mountain stronghold.",

      "Description": "The Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game is a simplified version that allows players to practice up to six laps or qualify for every Formula One race of the season using metric units (kilometres per hour instead of miles per hour). It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.\nBefore the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.",

But this time they've been given the most difficult mission ever: their commander asked for reinforcement support for the war emergency, but the enemy's frontier military post is located along the shortcut of the reinforced army's movement. Time is urgent! The commander decided to send a guerilla soldier to destroy the enemy's frontier military post in order for the reinforcements to pass through. Johnson and Berry are the storm-troopers who are the only team with a chance for success and survival!",

It was the first game to run on Namco's then new System 2 hardware, and is a direct successor to Namco's two earlier Pole Position games (1982-1983).\n\nFinal Lap was the first racing game to allow up to eight players to simultaneously race on the Suzuka Circuit, in a Formula One race. This was, at the time, considered a revolutionary feature and was implemented by linking together up to four two-player sitdown-style arcade cabinets.[2][3] It was also arguably the first racing game to implement \"rubber banding\" to ensure that less talented players were never too far behind the leader, a concept that would be taken much further by the Mario Kart series.[3] There was also a single player mode, in which the player's score was based on how far the car travelled until time ran out or if the player completed four laps (on default settings; the arcade operator can set the lap number to be as low as three or as high as six).",

There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck's ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety.",

Choose a number and look at the picture that's revealed underneath. Then choose another number and look at that picture. Do they match? If they do, they'll stay turned up. If they don't, they'll turn down again and your opponent gets to pick two more. Keep picking pairs until all the pictures are matched and the entire game board is uncovered. Play alone, play against a friend or even the computer. As you get better, the boards get harder, with more numbers and more pictures to remember. You can do it!",

      "Description": "Fist of the North Star is a side-scrolling action video game produced by Toei Animation and developed by Shouei System for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was first released in Japan under the title Hokuto no Ken 2, on April 17, 1987, being the second Hokuto no Ken video game released for the Family Computer (Famicom) by the anime production company (which briefly entered the video game publishing business after their success with the original Hokuto no Ken game for the Famicom in 1986), while also serving as a tie-in to the Hokuto no Ken 2 anime series which began airing on Fuji TV a few weeks earlier. Taxan published the localized NES version on April 1989, making it one of the earliest Fist of the North Star products released in the U.S. alongside Viz Communications' English adaptation of the manga.\n\nThe main differences from the Japanese version are:\n\n- The Japanese version is harder because projectiles are randomly thrown at you from the sides of the screen like in the previous game and the first two mini-bosses have to be hit in their heads.\n- Kenshiro's color was changed from black to blue.\n- The \"abeshi\" and \"hidebu\" power-ups were changed to white and black stars.\n- The NPCs that appear at the end of some stages were removed for the US version.\n- In the Japanese version, when you use a continue you are dropped in Stage 4. In the US version, you continue from the stage you were on.",

      "Description": "In a mysterious region of China, Ryuhi, was born and raised in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. At a young age he became a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.",

      "Description": "In an unexplored region of China wrapped in mystery, Ryuhi, a boy, was born and brought up in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. Though he was young, he made himself a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind's eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\" as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.",

For years the sun seemed to shine brighter and the crops grew taller than anyone could ever remember. Surely, their troubles were far behind them, and life was one blissful long walk through paradise. But, their wonderful world would be shattered in one mighty flash from the heavens. For lightning had struck the old tombstone that lay battered and overgrown with weeds in a dark corner of the ancient cemetary. And just as fiendish life had once been given to the dead, it would be given again. First a twitch of a finger, a flutter of a heartbeat, then a powerful surge of energy to the twisted criminal brain that so long ago had terrorized the land in the powerful body of the hideous monster. The horror was about to begin again... Frankenstein had risen from the dead!",

The game casts the player as one of six camp counselors (three girls or three boys) at the Camp Crystal Lake and the player´s main task is to defend the children in the cabins situated all around the lake while slowly killing Jason.\n\nThe cabins are frequently attacked by the mass murderer and the player must get to the attacked cabin within the specific time limit otherwise Jason kills the children. When all the camp counselors or all the children are dead, the game is over. Jason can attack the player outside cabins too, on the pathways when exploring. There are three cycles meaning, Jason must be killed three times (every time Jason is stronger and quicker) to beat the game.",

      "Description": "The general gameplay concept is that each level is like a child's version of The Running Man with a basic top-down view. Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).\nIn order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a \"chance.\" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.",

      "Description": "The gameplay is very similar to the original Gauntlet, a topdown dungeon crawl supporting up to four players. The biggest difference from the original game is that players can choose identical classes, instead of being limited to a particular one for each joystick; each player is differentiated by color. Thus, instead of having a \"warrior\", \"wizard\", and \"valkyrie\" (for instance), in Gauntlet II there could be a \"red wizard\", a \"blue elf\" and a \"green warrior\".\n\nIn addition to the new \"class\" system, new level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the play-field turned in steps of 90°. Other new features included the enemy \"It\", which upon contact would make a player \"It\" and draw all enemies towards him/her. The only way to release this curse is by touching another player or entering the exit, turning any level containing \"It\" into a fantasy filled game of tag. Other notable additions include the ability to ricochet shots off walls by means of a special pick-up, acid puddles that caused large, predetermined amounts of damage and a large dragon which would occupy multiple squares and require multiple hits to destroy.\n\nNew level elements were also added, adding more variety to the original game. These included \"all walls are invisible\", \"magic walls\" which changed into monsters or items when hit, \"stun tiles\" which stunned the player, and fake exits.\n\nAnother challenge in the game is the possibility to find a \"secret room\". This can be found by completing specific achievements within the level (e.g., \"don't be fooled\", means that you must find the real exit first). The secret room contains items such as food and magic potions (extra shot power, extra shot speed, extra magic power, extra speed, extra armor and extra fight power).\n\nThis sequel was also the first to feature what is now known as the Gauntlet theme tune, which resembles a simplified Baroque fugue.",

Yet one day an evil wizard wielded the powers of a Fire Dragon to destroy the peace. A legendary Pastha and 6 magicians fought the wizard and trapped the Dragon. But, the wizard cast a fateful curse, turning the magicians and Dragon into cold gems, which were placed upon the crown: The Gemfire.\nGemfire's powers preserved peace in Ishmeria, until King Eselred abused the magic for his greed. Then one day, the Pastha came to Princess Robyn to plea for her help. That very night she stole the crown and hurled the gems into the midnight sky! But before she could destroy the Dragon's ruby, King Eselred caught Robyn and seized the crown!\n\nIn search of virtuous leaders, the magicians flew to the far corners of Ishmeria. Still,to this day, they struggle against Eselred's wrath. The key to saving Ishmeria is in the hands of one ruler, the ruler who will reunite the magic of Gemfire...",

      "Description": "Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for \"ghost alarms\", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).",

However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the \"PK level\" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.",

Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.\n\nThe game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life.",

Spike brought the skull to his teacher and it is from here that our ghostly tale unfolds...The skull ended up being a beacon, a homing device for all the spirits and monsters from the realm of the dead. These ghouls from a land downunder have sort of captured your dream girl Samantha Pompom, the beautiful head cheerleader of the school. She's being held somewhere in the school and you've got to find her. (Everyone before you has failed -- but don't let that discourage you.)",

The golfer has been identified as Mario in supplemental material, albeit not wearing his traditional shirt and overalls. The gameplay of Golf is relatively simple. The player is given a ball, and a map on the right side of the screen shows the hole that they must hit the ball into. The obstacles on the way are also displayed on the map. The player will get more points depending on how many times they hit the ball to get it into the hole. Many different types of clubs are also available to choose from by pressing Up/Down on the + Control Pad.",

On the way, Golgo 13 must pass through several areas, including East Berlin, Athens, and Alexander Island, which is located off the coast of Antarctica. It is necessary to navigate several mazes in order to win, but one maze is a fake base with no way out. The mazes account for a large amount of the frustration players encounter with this game. The instruction manual contains maps for the mazes.",

You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot. One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.",

You'll use your Zapper light gun to blow away anything that gets in your way. But even with the Zapper, this case will be hard to crack. Because not only are the diamonds hard to find, but you only have 24 hours to find them! What's more, you'll have to think fast and shoot even faster, because ferocious monsters, diving airplanes and hungry man-eating sharks will stop at nothing to prevent you from getting to the diamonds. Think you're a sharp-shooting detective? Well, you better be. Because if you're not, it's curtains for you in this quick-on-the-trigger Nintendo Light Gun game!\n\nA direct port of the game was released for the Nintendo VS. System arcade machine in 1987.",

      "Description": "The most happening place in the universe is the trendy, upscale solar system of IOTA Synthetica, part of the Galactic Federation of artificial stars. It's as far from dirty old Earth as can be... But don't sign up to go yet! A strange cosmic energy field with a major attitude has engulfed the system, and the most outrageous things are happening. Ordinary inanimate objects are coming to life - harmless little animals are becoming rabid giants - and the freaked-out residents are under attack! The only Galactic Commander who can handle this ordeal is the eccentric renegade called Gun-Nac. He can oust this aura that's threatening the destruction of comfortable artificial life as we know it. But where in the universe is he? He could be as far away as Earth, searching for a new Game Pak. Commander Gun-Nac, if you read this, call H.Q., A.S.A.P., O.K.? We N.E.E.D. you!",

      "Description": "Heavy Barrel is a 1987 overhead run and gun arcade game by Data East.\n\nTerrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site, and it is up to the player to infiltrate the base and kill the enemy leader. Players begin armed with a laser gun with unlimited ammunition and a limited supply of grenades. Improved weapons and grenade powerups are made available within the game, either in plain sight or within crates that must be unlocked using keys. Additionally, crates may contain orbs or one of the six pieces of the Heavy Barrel superweapon. Like SNK's Ikari Warriors, the original arcade version featured 8-way rotary joysticks.\nThe name of the game is from an in-game weapon. The Heavy Barrel is found in six pieces and is an energy cannon capable of destroying any enemy in the game with a single shot (except the final enemy, and possibly one other boss that may have required two shots). The weapon has a wide arc of fire and can be fired as fast as the player's trigger finger permits, but after thirty seconds its use is exhausted, at which point the bearer reverts to his previous weaponry. Best used to get past tough bosses, the weapon could be built several times in a single game (probably three or four times). In a two-player game, whoever collects the sixth piece is equipped with the Heavy Barrel.",

You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.\n\nStrict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.",

      "Description": "Hokuto no Ken 2: Seikimatsu Kyuuseishu Densetsu is a side-scrolling action game for the Family Computer released by Toei Animation on April 17, 1987. It served as a tie-in to the anime series of the same name, being released a few days after the airing of its fifth episode. A version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released by Taxan in North America under the title of Fist of the North Star on April 1989, making it the earliest Hokuto no Ken tie-in product released outside Japan. Before release, the NES version was shown in the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in 1988 under the title of Ken the Great Bear Fist, Toei's proposed localized title for the series.\n\nBecause the game was produced at the same time as the Hokuto no Ken 2 anime series entered production, certain plot details differ from both, the manga and anime. Most notably, the renegade Gento Kō Ken masters from the anime, Taiga and Boltz, co-exists as enemy characters alongside Jakō's sons from the manga, Jask and Sheeno, while Bronza, a character exclusive to this game, serves as the General of the Red Light in place of Shoki, who filled the same role in the anime. While Shoki himself never appears in the game, his death at the hands of Sheeno is acknowledged in the official strategy guide. The game only covers the Tentei story arc, with a bonus stage featuring the Nameless Asura as a hidden final boss.",

      "Description": "Hollywood Squares is a quiz game based on the television game show Hollywood Squares. Versions were released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and Apple II. The game is based on the 1986-1989 version hosted by John Davidson. The photo of the set is from the 1985 series pilot (the actual show had no gold stars on the studio floor and more elaborate risers for the cars).\n\nPlayers have to either agree or disagree with fictitious celebrities to earn squares and make tic-tac-toe. Much like the TV series, winning one of the first two games is worth $500, the third game is worth $1,000 and the second game is always the \"Secret Square\" game. The winner then goes on to the bonus round, where they have to choose one of five keys and insert it into the proper car among the five offered.",

The legends of the Playground are all here: Mr. Doc, Jammer, Legs, Bomber, Wiz, eight players in all. You can pit them one-on-one or two-on-two. You pick the court - Eastern or Western - and you pick the rules, too. You can play against the computer or one other player. Or you can even team up with another player against the computer. You can block shots, make steals, pass off or go strong to the hoop - in fact, you control just about everything in this ultra-realistic rendition of the playground game. Except, of course, the final score. But win or lose, you know you've been in a game after you've played a game of HOOPS!",

      "Storyline": "The play and mechanics of Ice Hockey are mostly similar to that of ice hockey in real life. The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking / defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design. If two opposing players fight for the puck for a certain amount of time, other players join into the fight, resulting in the player from the losing team in the fight to be put in the penalty box for a period of time.",

One after another, mankind's other military industrial space complexes were being lost. What mankind dreaded had come to pass. Scores of unidentified fighters were in the area. In addition, the moon's main computer, still intact after the explosion, had a strange vegetation coiled around it. Their trademark evil exploits being a dead giveaway, invaders from the Boondoggle Galaxy had arrived to take over the Earth. To counter these evil forces, leading scientists from all over the globe created the \"OF-1\" Fightership. Combat pilots depart the Earth to fend off the invaders and earn everlasting glory.",

Venture into the dungeon and slove the mysteries of each level. Unravel the secrets of The Immortal!\n\nThe Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.\n\nYour old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.\n\nThe Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.",

      "Description": "In Ironsword, the hero of the series, Kuros, must face off once again against the evil wizard Malkil, who has taken control of the four elementals of the world—wind, water, fire and earth. Each of the four elemental realms consists of two stages. In the first stage, Kuros must find a golden artifact which belongs to the Animal King of the realm; once accomplished, the path to the second part of the realm will appear. In the second stage, the goal is to find the magic spell which can be used to fight the elemental boss. Without the spell, it is impossible to damage the boss. Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros obtains a piece of the legendary Iron Sword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain.",

Fame, glory and bikini clad women await your victories and the taste of dirt awaits if you fail. Let a computer car beat you and you lose one of your 3 credits.\n\nSuccessful races bring more money, which can be used to soup up their machine. Boosts to top speed, grip and acceleration can be purchased, and your nitro boost must be kept topped up. If you are desperate for upgrades, you can buy into your spare credits.\n\nOnly your off-road driving abilities will be enough to pull you to first place in these races. Play alone or with up to 3 other players (depending on the version) in this classic arcade game.",

      "Description": "Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf is a golf-simulation video game developed by Sculptured Software, and published by Accolade in 1988.\nThe game features simulations of eighteen holes from renowned golf courses in the United States, Scotland, and England: Four from Augusta National Golf Club, three from Pebble Beach Golf Links, three from the Old Course at St Andrews, two from the Riviera Country Club, two from Baltusrol Golf Club, one from Oakmont Country Club, one from Merion Golf Club, one from Muirfield, and one from Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club. In addition, the game contains simulations of two complete Nicklaus-designed 18-hole courses: The Castle Pines Golf Club and The Golf Club at Desert Mountain.\nIt also bears the name and likeness of American professional golfer Jack Nicklaus. Less than two years before the game's publication, Nicklaus won the final major golf championship of his career: the 1986 Masters Tournament. Augusta National Golf Club hosted the tournament. Players can compete against Nicklaus as a computer opponent, or any of eight other computer opponents of varying skill levels.\nJack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf was a commercial success for Jack Nicklaus Productions and Accolade. The two companies developed it into a video game franchise, and Accolade published numerous adaptations and sequels for more than ten years.",

As China's supreme kung fu champs, they guard their country against the Prince of Sorcerers, who lurks just beyond the Great Wall. It comes as no surprise when this fiend and his ghouls try yet again to seize China for themselves. But this time they're clever, casting a spell over Josephine which causes her to vanish into thin air! Jackie is in shock! How can he save his country without his sister? The two have been an unbeatable team! Meanwhile, a demon horde led by the Sorcerer storms the Great Wall and prepares to establish a fierce empire. At the urging of his revered Master, Jackie must now battle the dreaded Sorcerer and rescue Josephine. Maybe he can learn a little magic on his own, because he's going to need all the help he can get!",

Two players may play competitively. The Game Boy version of the game allows two-player competitive play over a Game Link Cable.\n\nIn french markets, Jimmy Connors was replaced with Yannick Noah as the title athlete.",

You call the plays, you throw the passes, run the ball, and make the tackles. It's third down and a long four long yards to the first down that will stop the clock. No time-outs left. The weak side linebacker is lined up inside his defensive end. They're coming! You check-off the play at the line of scrimmage and call for a quick pass to the tight end. He breaks it for a T.D.! Named for the quarterback who twice won the AFC Player of the Year Award, this is the game made for every kid who ever wanted to play the game as well as John Elway!",

      "Description": "Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua & The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.\nThough the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).\n\nGameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).",

As a result, the graphics and storyline were altered to accommodate this change, but remnants of the earlier version still remain in the game.

However, the space station is obliterated in an explosion, killing the entire research team and destroying all data on board.\nIn his father's home, Jay discovers a floppy disk containing not only the complete SSS colony plans but a personal message from his father asking that he complete the projects should terrorists succeed in destroying the colony.

      "Description": "Karateka is a 1984 beat'em up video game by Jordan Mechner, and was his first game created while attending Yale University. It was originally programmed for the Apple II, and was later ported to several other home computers and early gaming consoles. The game was published in North America by Brøderbund, and in Europe by Ariolasoft.\n\nThe player controls an unnamed protagonist who is attempting to rescue his love interest, the Princess Mariko, from Akuma's castle fortress. The game exhibits a combination of a side-scrolling platform and fighting game elements. The player uses punches and kicks to defeat Akuma and his guards and make his way deeper into the fortress. The game, as with most at the time of development, lacked checkpoints or the ability to save the game, making it a challenge to complete in a single sitting.\n\nKarateka has been well-received, particularly for its realistic animations used for the game's characters. The game was considered a breakthrough success for Mechner, and would eventually result in his development of the Prince of Persia franchise. A high-definition remake, spearheaded by Mechner, was released as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, with planned ports for the iOS and Wii U systems.",

Using his magic powers the wizard quickly overpowered the helpless people, put everybody including Princess Mira, into \"dream bags\", and turned the entire kingdom into a frozen wasteland.\n\nIt is your job as Kickle to progress through all of the areas within each of the four lands in the country and eliminate all of the Wizard's henchmen and rescue your friends who are held captive in a dreamless sleep.\n\nKickle Cubicle is a captivating puzzle game much on the lines of the old coin-op game Pengo. More recently though, it contains similar concepts seen in the Lolo series of NES carts where planning and strategy is more important than quick moves.\n\nYour main weapon is your 'chilling' ice breath. Breathe on the enemy and they instantly freeze! Give them a kick and they're out of your way! Clear a couple dozen mazes and you come to the end of the land you're in where you must then beat one of the Boss creatures.\n\nThrow in springs, hammers, bonus stages and secret traps and the game quickly turns into a puzzle game with levels which start easy but increase in difficulty as you get better!",

      "Storyline": "The game is set in Angel Land, which is a fantasy world with a Greek mythology theme. The backstory of Kid Icarus is described in the instruction booklet: before the events of the game, Earth was ruled by Palutena: Goddess of Light and Medusa: Goddess of Darkness. Palutena bestowed the people with light to make them happy. Medusa hated the humans, dried up their crop, and turned them to stone. Enraged by this, Palutena transformed Medusa into a monster and banished her to the Underworld. Out of revenge, Medusa conspired with the monsters of the Underworld to take over Palutena's residence the Palace in the Sky. She launched a surprise attack, and stole the three sacred treasures — the Mirror Shield, the Light Arrows and the Wings of Pegasus — which deprived Palutena's army of its power. After her soldiers had been turned to stone by Medusa, Palutena was defeated in battle and imprisoned deep inside the Palace in the Sky.\n\nWith her last power, she sent a bow and arrow to the young angel Pit. He escapes from his prison in the Underworld and sets out to save Palutena and Angel Land. Throughout the course of the story, Pit retrieves the three sacred treasures from the fortress gatekeepers at their respective fortresses in the Underworld, the Overworld, and the Skyworld. Afterward, he equips himself with the treasures and storms the sky temple where he defeats Medusa and rescues Palutena. The game has five different endings; depending on the player's performance, Palutena may present Pit with headgear or transform him into a full-grown angel.",

      "Description": "King's Knight is a fantasy-themed top-down shooter where four heroes have to unite to defeat a dragon and rescue a princess in despair. It was one of the first games published by Square Soft (now one-half of Square Enix). King's Knight is a variation on Konami's Knightmare which sold extremely well.\n\nThe first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:\n\nRay Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power; Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping; Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.\n\nIt is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.",

For some mysterious reason, the Dream Spring, a magical well that is the reservoir for all the dreams of the citizens of Dream Land, is no longer working. Everyone is being subjected to their worst nightmares every time they go to sleep. Upon reaching the Dream Spring, Kirby finds out that evil King Dedede has stolen the Star Rod, thus depriving Dream Land of the magical energy that feeds its spring. Using 20 unique tricks and your ability to steal your enemies' powers by swallowing them, you'll have to make your way through a horrific land filled with all kinds of nightmares. Recover the broken pieces of the Star Rod, and everyone in Dream Land will sleep peacefully once again. If you fail, the citizens of Dream Land will be subjected to a lifetime of terrible nightmares.",

Wiebenson pitched Kitty's Catch to several publishers, all of which refused to publish the game. Eventually, several prototypes were discovered and purchased in a lot by the Nolan brothers, who released the most complete ROM to the public. Kitty's Catch is a two-player game where players control cats named Pitter and Patter, and have to catch fish with their tails. The first player to fill their bucket with fish gets a shell, and the player with the most shells at the end of the time limit wins. There are also several power-ups obtained by collecting tin cans, such as larger hooks.",

Up and down, left and right, or diagonally you gotta make the clumps of critters move out faster than they move in. If the room fills to capacity, that's it, the entire system will be shut down.

      "Description": "A summer offensive in the year 1999. Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six \"G\" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle's just begun, and there's no time to kill between firefights!",

The action takes place in outer space from a side-scrolling perspective where the ship always remains lined up in the middle of the screen but is able to turn forwards and backwards while accelerating and decelerating. The ship can also collapse into a slimmer configuration. Enemies come at you from all directions and in all formations. Shoot them as quickly as possible while also disabling the enemy fleet's starcruisers as best you can.\n\nThe game also features a 2-player mode where each player takes turns fighting the armada.",

The player controls Link and must make his way through the forests, graveyards, plains and deserts of the Otherworld to find the secret entrances to the eight dungeons and try to restore the broken Triforce. Among the game's mechanics, it was the first time we saw a continuous world that could be freely explored, power-ups that permanently enhanced the main character's abilities and a battery save feature that allowed players to keep their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced action sequences with discovery, secrets and exploration.",

For hundreds of years, DARK has governed with wisdom and justice.\n\nBut now the unthinkable has happened: DARK is malfunctioning, and humanity is writhing in the grasp of a ruthless tyrant. DARK has built a fleet of robot warships to patrol the skies, and has created an army of mutant monsters to guard the underground bases from which he now terrorizes mankind. Lulled by hundreds of years of peace, the people of earth are defensless against the minions of DARK. But two brave young men, following an ancient legend of Greek mythology, have devised mechanical wings to bear them aloft in search of DARK's hidden fortress.\n\nArmed with the last remaining guns and missiles from a crumbling arsenal, you must fly them across the continents and oceans to seek out and destroy the cruel colossus!\n\nRobot warships and floating mines are a constant menace. And you must beware of the Giant Head, a grotesque stone face guarding the entrance to each of DARK's underground bases. If you approach too near to its gaping mouth, you will be sucked into the depths, where bizarre mutant monsters prowl the corridors.\n\nIf you fail, mankind is lost. Take wing, Legendary Soldiers!",

      "Description": "M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.\n\nYou start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.\n\nEach turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.\n\nAfter the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.",

A magician named Isfa, harnessing the power of the blue star Airosche, vanquished the demons and sealed them underground. Peace briefly returned until the evil wizard Sabaron freed Goragora and the demons from their captivity and imprisoned the Arabian princess Scheherazade and her family.",

The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.",

The journey is a difficult one though, because the castle is locked up tight and Milon doesn't have the keys. You will have to use your bubble attacks to fend off the castle baddies while busting up every block in sight trying to find all of the hidden treasure and other secrets throughout the game. Unlike most platformers, Milon's Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle! Milo can uncover practically anything in the game. This includes: items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops! The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!",

      "Description": "Menace Beach is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Color Dreams in 1990. Like all Color Dreams games, Menace Beach was not officially licensed by Nintendo. It was also re-released as part of the Maxivision 15-in-1 multicart.\nAccording to the game's instruction manual, the player controls a skateboarding hero whose girlfriend, Bunny, has been kidnapped by Demon Dan. An introduction screen shows a shackled Bunny pleading for the player's help. In the game, the hero must use his skateboard and any objects he finds, such as balloons, frogs, bombs and bottles, to defeat ninja, clowns and disgruntled dock workers before finally confronting the villainous Demon Dan. The game was somewhat infamous because in-between levels the girlfriend's clothes \"rot\" away, by when the first level is completed, parts of her clothes rot away until the girl is in nothing else but in her bra and panties.",

Whatever few lifeforms survived were driven underground or transformed into battling bionic mutants. You must escape the tentacles of these mutants, seek out and destroy alien ships, then overpower grotesque alien guards to steal their fiendish and bizarre weapons. From barren landscapes and colorful coral reefs to abandoned and frozen cities, you will yet come face to face with the alien tyrant in each world!",

      "Description": "Metro-Cross is a platform arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs upon Namco Pac-Land hardware (but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster, modified to support a 2048-color palette). It uses a Motorola M6809 microprocessor, with a Hitachi HD63701 sub-microprocessor (both running at 1.536 MHz) and Namco 8-channel waveform PSG for audio.\n\nThe player must take control of a man known only as Runner, who is given a time limit to run through each of the game's thirty-two rounds while avoiding obstacles and collecting drink cans. The actual running happens automatically: the job of the player is to avoid the obstacles and collect the cans by moving the Runner with the stick and adjusting his speed accordingly.\n\nIf the Runner finishes the round within the time limit, the remaining time will be awarded to him as bonus points and he will proceed to the next round. Every fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous ones as additional time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round by the time the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game will immediately be over.",

      "Description": "Global Gladiators (also known as Mick and Mack: Global Gladiators) is a 1992 platform game by Virgin Interactive, originally programmed by David Perry (who at the time had already moved to the United States and was located on the recently formed Virgin Games USA development studio) for the Mega Drive/Genesis and eventually ported by other Virgin Interactive teams in Europe (with the help of Graftgold and Krisalis Software) to the Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear and the Commodore Amiga. A Super Nintendo port was also in development but was never completed for undisclosed reasons, though a prototype exists on the Internet. The game is loosely based on the McDonald's fast food chain and has a strong environmentalist message.\n\nA Game Boy port of the title was also fully developed (by Damian Stones, of Climax) but was never released for the same legal reasons as the Super Nintendo port.\n\nIn the single-player game, the player controls Mick or Mack through four worlds; Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-town and Arctic World. Each world has several sub-stages where the character must collect a certain number of Golden Arches to advance.\n\nThey are guided in their quest by Ronald McDonald, who appears at the beginning and the end of the game. The characters are armed with a Super Soaker-type gun that shoots gooey projectiles.\n\nThe game engine is the same used in other Virgin Interactive games such as Cool Spot and Disney's Aladdin, as all of them (Mega Drive/Genesis versions) were handled by David Perry's programming team, which eventually turned into Shiny Entertainment.",

      "Description": "A platform game where the main character travels throughout various levels collecting bombs. The hero of the game, Jack, must make his way through 16 levels of a pyramid in order to defeat the demon Belzebut and rescue the royal Pamera family.Each level is split into two parts an action zone and a Royal Palace room. The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from the games prequel, Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the games timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.To prevent the player from becoming too greedy, the game automatically sends the player to a Torture Room if they obtain more than 9 Mighty Coins or 99 seconds on the games timer. The only way to escape a Torture Room without losing a life is to complete a number of jumps, which are counted down on the screen. Once the player exits the torture room, Jack automatically loses all Mighty Coins, the timer is reset to 60 seconds, and the game recommences from the beginning of the current level.A Royal Palace room NES version.A Vs. Series version of the game was released in 1986 for the Japanese market not to be confused with the original dedicated arcade version. Differences between the original and vs. series versions include adding a two-player mode, changing the locations of some secret passages and removing a warp trick in the Royal Palace rooms. In the NES version, Jack could warp forward to the next Royal Palace room if he touched the first lit bomb in the current room after the other 23 bombs were collected however, if Jack died in the warping process, he would be sent back to the beginning of the level from which the trick commenced.Mighty Bomb Jack also had a guest appearance on Tecmo Super Bowl, during the halftime show in the Super Bowl",

      "Description": "Punch-Out!!, originally released in North America as Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, is a boxing sports fighting video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) developed and published by Nintendo in 1987. Part of the Punch-Out!! series, it is a port of both the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcade games (particularly the latter) with some variations.\nPunch-Out!! features a boxer known as Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version.\nLittle Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. The player can acquire up to three stars. To perform the uppercut, the player needs to press the start button once a star is earned. To defend, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block punches by putting up his guard.\nLittle Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking/dodging the player's attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack but still able to dodge or block. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent's punches. He immediately loses all of his hearts upon being knocked down, but can regain some by getting up.\nA bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within ten seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate higher than a certain point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down (different boxers require different point totals to win by decision). However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner and will automatically result in a loss for the player if the opponent is not knocked out. Mac can only get up three times during any one bout; if he is knocked down a fourth time, he will be unable to rise and thus lose by knockout.\nWhen Mac loses his first bout to a ranked opponent, he will have a chance to fight a rematch. However, if he loses a Title Bout, he will fall in the rankings - one place for the Minor or Major Circuits, two places for the World Circuit. Losing a rematch causes him to fall one place (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit), forcing him to fight his way back up. A third loss (not necessarily a consecutive one) ends the game. The exception is the final fight against Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream; a loss to them automatically results in a game over.",

      "Description": "Millionaire is a version of the popular board game Monopoly. The rules are pretty similar to the original, but the places in the board are the most noticeable difference. Instead of pieces of land with street names, the board features country names, such as Spain, Turkey or Switzerland. After buying such places, players can build houses or hotels.\n\nUp to four players can take turns in this game. Each one starts with 7.500 dollars, and leaves the board when there's no money left to pay the bills. The last player standing wins.",

The journey is a difficult one though, because the castle is locked up tight and Milon doesn't have the keys. You will have to use your bubble attacks to fend off the castle baddies while busting up every block in sight trying to find all of the hidden treasure and other secrets throughout the game. Unlike most platformers, Milon's Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle! Milo can uncover practically anything in the game. This includes: items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops! The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!",

      "Description": "Thousands of history's famous monsters gather for the meeting of the century. But their volcanic convention center erupts, mysteriously turning them into terrors of pint-size proportions. They escape to the home of Jack, the teenage \"Captain of Cool.\" There begins a battle between the good ghouls and The Warlock's band of evil beasts. You must become The Vampire or The Monster and lead the forces of right through a humongous, human-size world six levels deep, featuring Jack's house, a scummy sewer, a hazardous construction site, and an odd oriental palace. Don't get burned on the kitchen stove or crushed by runaway golf balls. Meanwhile you'll have to punch and zap at all your fiendishly favorite monsters including the head-rolling Skeleton, the rock candy throwing Goblin, the bone-crushing Cyclops, and dozens more! Every monster you mash is worth points. Score enough and you'll get an extra life. Something you'll really need when you finally face the powerful Warlock and his magic lightning jolts. So be a pocket-size peacemaker and conquer the smallest threat to monsterdom the world has ever known!",

When Mark regained his sight, a mysterious creature was standing before him. The creature told an eerie tale about his home planet, the Dark World, where evil monsters were terrorizing the helpless population. He was searching the galaxy for a warrior capable of freeing them from their terrible plight. The creature explained that Mark's bat was the perfect weapon for defeating the evil monsters.

CPI, the Central Programing Institute, is what allows the world to exist the way it does. It controls everything; from global databases and grids to holographic theater software as well as the simple timing of the traffic signals. But something is terribly wrong tonight... cities around the globe have lost their power and data feeds. There have been several major aerial collisions between passenger liners and heavy freighters and the skyways have been closed until global traffic control is back on-line. All power and light have been lost and the atmospheric control system can only continue to function on auxiliary power for the verge of collapse. There is rioting reported in several areas. What's going on??? This appears to be more than a simple system's bug... but how much more?",

      "Description": "NES Open Tournament Golf is an NES game featuring Mario characters. As the name of the game implies, it is a golf game and was one of the first golfing games in the Mario series. You can play a round of golf on one of three different courses. One or two players can play in the U.S., Japan, or the U.K. and choose a stroke or match play game. Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook.",

But Sutekh's seedy underworld is about to be infiltrated by a superhero unlike the world has even seen. A superhero who can melt into the darkness like a phantom.\n\nBy day this brave crimefighter is a common ordinary citizen. But when night falls, he is cloaked in a secret identity to seek out and destroy the dark forces that lurk on midnight streets. Who is this man the press calls Nightshade? Only you can answer that... for he is you.\n\nEvery night you solidify your superhero status, patrolling one hundred of the city's darkest corners, including King Rat's filthy underground hideout and the League of Unreasonable Gentlemen. Here you'll find thieves, muggers and other alley scum that you must either deal with or destroy for clues. But be warned. You're not the only night stalker. For as you hunt Sutekh, Sutekh hunts you with the human printing press, the closing wall of spikes, deadly jackal pits, and the chilling freeze ray.\n\nTo overcome these treacherous obstacles, you must seek out hidden weapons, including energy domes, force gloves and The Staff of Ra. More importantly, you must use problem solving skills to outsmart five crime kings who hold the inner secrets to Sutekh's Lair.\n\nOf course the ultimate key to destroying Sutekh is your popularity. For it's a power source that gives you the wits to decipher clues and the strength to pulverize villains and rescue innocent bystanders. Remember. If this heroic prowess ever diminishes, you'll no longer control the night. You'll be consumed by it.",

      "Description": "In the year 1990, Nintendo held a now rather famous video game competition called Nintendo World Championships as part of the Powerfest traveling video game festival. Contestants would compete against each other in a triathlon of the NES titles Super Mario Bros, Rad Racer, and Tetris. The ROMs themselves were modified to suit the competition, and the winners would be determined by an overall score count from all three games. High placing winners took home a cash prize amongst other goodies. However, the finalists of this competition each took home their own copy of the specially made ROM on a standard NES cartridge. Another issue of the cartridge, colored in a golden tint similar to The Legend of Zelda cartridge, was even more elusive and was only distributed as a prize giveaway in Nintendo Power Magazine. Today, these two cartridge variations are some of the most elusive and sought after video games in history and are often considered a holy grail of video game collecting. As of recent years, only 116 gray cartridges and 26 golden cartridges are known to have ever been printed.",

      "Description": "Your objective is ensure victory for your side by eliminating all the enemy armies. You will be controlling armies across all the combat zones of the Civil War. You may respect history or not, as you like. North and South does not try to reconstitute history and places playability over realism, it only tries to emulate the atmosphere and overall strategic conditions of the Civil War. Thus, as in reality, the player may choose to advance deep into the South or North, to attack in the center or to attempt a turning movement.\n\nThis game can be played against computer or between two human opponents. You can also choose between a full strategic mode without the arcade parts or use the arcade mode during the fights, which allows you to directly control your own units.",

However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four \"buffer\" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact.\n\nTo make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the player can.\n\nThe player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option.\n\nBlood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.",

Starting as a rookie, many enemy ships need to be destroyed to earn credits that can be exchanged for fuel, armor, weapons, shields and warp drives. The commander instructs you with specific missions, such as destroying outposts or freeing alien groups. However, your ultimate goal is to find the Toson Drive, the only device powerful enough to reach P'radikus. To spice things up, there are many weapons such as shock waves, mines, missiles, cloaking devices and atomic cannons. As your fuel constantly depletes, you often need to orbit new planets to refuel and stock weapons.",

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!",

      "Storyline": "The Story of Parasol Stars\nOnce, long ago, there was a courageous warrior that entered a Cave of Monsters with the intent of sealing it forever. He accomplished this task, however, unknown to him, one monster escaped before the cave was sealed. Years passed, and that one monster eventually grew strong enough to break the power of the warrior's magic seal. That monster, who became known as Chaostikhan, unleashed the monsters within the cave on the world once again.\n\nDuring this same period of time, Bubby and Bobby, our heroes, had won the admiration of the villagers of Rainbow Islands by defeating the enemies terrorizing their planet, allowing peace to settle in. To show their appreciation, the inhabitants of the Island entrusted one Magic Parasol each to Bubby and Bobby. In the months that followed, Bub and Bob were so intent on learning to harness the power of the Magic Parasols that they did not notice the menacing presence that was overtaking the neighboring planets. One day, they received an emergency distress signal from one of those nearby planets. Though they had not quite mastered the techniques for using the Magic Parasols, they courageously raised their parasols toward the planet in distress and disappeared into the skies above Rainbow Island, unaware of the danger and size of their new quest.\n\nThe Story So Far\nAfter rescuing the inhabitants of Rainbow Islands in their last hair-raising adventure, Bub and Bob are enjoying a well earned vacation. However, their peace is shattered when the warmongering warrior Chaostikhan unleashes a magma of menacing monsters throughout the universe.\n\nWith their magic parasols in hand (gifts from the grateful Rainbow Islanders) Bub and Bob must defeat the monsters and free the universe.",

      "Description": "The excitement of one of the America's most popular party games comes to the NES with Pictionary. Not only are the elements of the board game there, but so are several picture-based mini-games. Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people.\n\nThe basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins.\n\nIn addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include \"Attack of the Paint Zombies\" (similar to Space Invaders), \"The Warehouse Shuffle\" (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), \"Four Alarm Rescue\" (catching people as they jump out of windows), and \"Leapin' Energy Casules!\" (capturing energy balls to fuel your spaceship).\n\nThere are also other game modes that enable you to use cards you may have for an actual Pictionary board game or a practice mode enabling you to simply draw.",

      "Description": "Pinball is a game where the player controls the paddles of a virtual pinball machine. The game has two screens to represent the traditional pinball table and one for a bonus mode. Play begins when the player launches a ball with the plunger from first screen through the top of the screen to the second screen. Play will move to the first screen if the ball falls through the bottom of the top screen and will return to the top screen if the ball is hit back through the space at the top of the first screen. If the ball falls through the hole to the right bottom at the top level, the player will enter a mini-game featuring Mario and Lady. The player controls the paddles on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.",

      "Description": "Don't let the name fool you - Pinball Quest is much more than video pinball. In fact, it's the first-ever multi-screen fantasy in a pinball format! Every move you make tells a story; every shot takes you another step closer in your quest to rescue the captive princess of the castle. Along the way you'll meet ghosts, goblins, witches and demons, in an endless labyrinth of treacherous passages and deadly doorways. It takes a fearless heart and a fast mind to conquer Pinball Quest. It also takes the skills of a true pinball wizard... which you can hone on the three other video pinball games included on this cartridge! So before you pour any more money into your NES library, get the one title that's a library all by itself! No matter how hard you try, you can't get enough of Pinball Quest!",

In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.\n\nThe game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.",

The Intergalactic Boxing Federation (IGBF) has invited you to go head-to-head with 12 of their greatest fighters. From metallic cyborgs, to heavy hitting mutants, you'll trade punches with opponents whose strength, stamina and speed are like nothing you've ever seen. If pure technique doesn't stop these sluggers (and with the best of them it won't), get hold of those Power Punches. They'll guarantee to send your tin-coated opponent to the junkyard and you to a new title; undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the Universe!",

There's instant replay, as well as new and improved animation, graphics, music and sound effects to make the game come alive. As the manager, you get the designated-hitter rule, switch-hitting, and your own lineup of starters and subs. It's so great, it's approved by the Major League Baseball Players Association!",

      "Description": "Presented in an overhead isometric perspective, a single player races a radio-controlled car around a series of tracks. The objective of each track is to qualify for the next race by placing in the top three racers. Players collect items to improve performance, and they must avoid a variety of hazards such as rain puddles and oil slicks. It is an example of a racing game which features vehicular combat, in which racers can use missiles and bombs to temporarily disable opposing vehicles.\n\nThe game distanced itself from earlier racing titles by using an overhead, instead of a first-person, perspective. Reviews have cited it as inspiration for future games such as Super Off Road, Rock n' Roll Racing, and the Mario Kart series. It has appeared in many \"top games of all time\" lists and is regarded as one of the best titles in the NES library.",

      "Description": "Racermate Challenge II is not a game that was readily available to the public. As a specially-ordered game from Computrainer, it was used to help increase bikers' performance for marathons and races. It came in an oversized Computrainer shipping box and typically included a top loader NES, multiple manuals (all different), Racermate Challenge II cart, and several accessories in which you used to hook your bike up to the NES. The game would keep track of your speed and endurance and let you know how well you were doing. A rather odd game and extremely tough to find anywhere especially complete since many would have thrown the box and manuals away.",

Besides a tournament with several matches against more and more experienced opponents and the training mode, the player can also participate in a free match. Here the match parameters can be set beforehand, e.g. the court surface or the number of sets (one or best of three). One special feature is that the player can complain to the referee.",

As you confront Pitbull's dealers and robotic \"Cyborg\" servants you will seize their drugs and money. The money will enable you to purchase the tools needed to overcome the obstacles in your path. Don't let the beauty of the streets fool you, for you are about to enter a world of laser beams, exploding mines and secret entrances. Engage your enemies as you traverse through the Pier, the Streets of Technopolis, and the Warehouse searching for clues. You will encounter more danger as you pilot a boat across the Swamp and travel through Space to an eventual confrontation with Pitbull himself in the Computer Center!",

Before making his way to the POW camp he has to fight guards and mercenaries that can kick and shoot him, all wearing different color shirts depending on how powerful they are. The game also requires the player to navigate a complex map requiring the player to find North and South points on the ground to go up and down levels as well as East and West by moving Rambo to the edge of the screen. There are 6 different weapons that Rambo can pick up that are knife, throwing knife, bow and arrow, bow and exploring arrow, gun, and hand grenade. All the weapons but the knife has limited ammo which is collected from killed enemies. There is also health vile that restores health as well as mission specific items that Rambo must find to complete some missions. The game uses password save that can be retrieved when talking to any person.",

      "Description": "Unlike Technos' subsequent game Double Dragon, the playing field is limited to one two-screen-wide area (a subway platform, a harbor, an alley, a parking lot and the hideout of a gang) and does not scroll continuously. Out of the four stages in the game, the first, second and third each begin with the player fighting a group made up of two different types of small fry enemies: one with fewer hit points and a stronger attack (usually armed with a weapon) and one with more hit points, but with a weaker attack and the ability to grab the player from behind, making him vulnerable to other enemies' attacks.\n\nWhen only three underlings remain (in any combination of the two) their boss will come in from the sidelines and join the fight. When the boss is defeated, any remaining enemies retreat off the bottom of the screen, and the stage ends. The second stage follows this same formula, but begins with a series of enemies riding motorcycles trying to run the player down, and brings in the normal enemies once the bikers have been defeated. The third stage is a gang of women; their boss is a very large woman who cannot easily be knocked to the ground. The fourth stage features a single type of knife-wielding enemy who can kill the player with one hit. Once the player has defeated this first wave of enemies, the main character proceeds to enter a building at the far right of the stage. There, he faces three more knife-wielding enemies and the final boss, a mobster whose gunfire is also deadly with one hit. Once the final boss is defeated, the main character exits the building and is greeted by his rescued girlfriend, who proceeds to give him a kiss. The game then begins the next cycle with an increased difficulty.\n\nIn addition to an eight-direction joystick, there are three buttons; left attack, right attack, and jump. Pressing the attack in the direction the character is facing will punch, while attacking in the opposite direction will perform a rear kick. Jumping, followed immediately by one of the attack buttons, which will perform a jumping kick in the direction of the attack.\n\nPressing the joystick twice quickly either left or right will cause the player to run, at which point attacking in the direction of the run will perform a running punch, jumping will automatically perform a flying kick, and attacking in the opposite direction will bring the player to a sudden halt and perform a back-kick. Pressing down over a downed enemy will make the player sit on top of the enemy, at which point attacking toward the enemy will cause the player to pummel him. The bosses can only be sat on if all normal enemies have been defeated, and unless the boss' energy level is low enough, he'll throw the player off.",

The goal is to reach the finish line within the stages without running out of time, hitting other cars or running out of fuel (fuel is refilled by hitting a special type of car). The game also spawned two sequels in its time, Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 in 1995 and Winding Heat in 1996, respectively. A Japan-only rebooted sequel was also released in 2010, 14 years after Winding Heat.",

There is no limit to how many vehicles a player can receive to complete a rally, as long as they have fuel. However, the destruction of the vehicle will subtract a small amount from the player's fuel tank. In the arcade, Genesis and Lynx versions, players could start the game at a higher rally, with additional opportunities to jump several levels from time to time. Players can continue their game from where they left off; however, the player has only one chance to complete the 50th and final rally. For completing the final rally the player gets one million points as a bonus. Players can get fuel in four ways: green globes, red globes, a checkpoint, and the rally point.",

While King Richard the Lion-Hearted is off fighting the Crusades in Jerusalem, the relentlessly greedy Sheriff of Nottingham rises to power by running roughshod over the poor folk of Britain. Now you are Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, the only man with enough cunning, agility and courage to combat the Sheriff and his evil witch, Mortianna. First, you must battle cutthroat guards and escape the Saracen dungeon where you, your friend, Peter Dubois, and your new companion, the mysterious, but loyal, Azeem, are held prisoners of the Crusades. Back in England, you'll explore the treacherous Sherwood Forest where you'll muster your band: Little John, Friar Tuck and Will Scarlett. But remember, they will only follow you if you prove yourself worthy enough to lead them, rescue the lovely Maid Marian and free England from tyranny.",

      "Description": "RoboCop 2 is a series of video games published in the 1990s by Ocean and Data East for various home computers and video game consoles. They are based on the movie of the same name. Three different games were produced, each produced on two systems.\n\nThe version for the Commodore 64 and NES was a simple left-to-right scrolling platformer, in which RoboCop was required to collect/destroy at least two-thirds of the drug \"nuke\" in each level and arrest two-thirds of the suspects by running into them (in contrast to shooting them). If RoboCop does not manage to attain the required amounts of nuke or number of arrests then he has two chances in the game to prove his efficiency at a shooting range. If he succeeds, he may continue onto the next level. If he fails, or if both chances at the shooting range are already used up, he must repeat the level.\n\nThe version for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC was also a platform game, but one that offered movement in both directions (vertically and horizontally) as well as into various areas providing an element of exploration. There were also a number of puzzle sub-games that had to be completed to progress in the game.\n\nThe version for the 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST was similar in nature to the 8-bit Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions, but contained completely different levels to take advantage of the extra power offered by these computers.\n\nThere was also an arcade-only version of RoboCop 2, developed and published in 1991 by Data East (who still held the rights to create arcade games based on the franchise), which allowed up to two players at once (one controlling the original RoboCop, the other controlling a slightly purple-hued clone). The game followed the basic premise of the movie, but had some major sequential differences.",

After his stunt plane was wrecked accidentally in a shootout between a couple of thugs and G-Men, the hoods had stashed an amazing stolen device in his cockpit. It didn't take long to figure out it was a rocketpack. And it took even less time for Cliff to become a target for half the city. The hoods wanted the stolen device back. So did its inventor, the famous, but eccentric American industrialist, not to mention the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the most menacing force of all, the Nazis! Even famous film star Neville Sinclair wanted the rocketpack. He had kidnapped Cliff's girlfriend, the gorgeous Jenny Blake, and was offering to exchange her for the device. Cliff had no time to ponder his desperate situation. There was only one course of action; he must become THE ROCKETEER!",

      "Description": "Join one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history for Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball. While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox.\n\nThe gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.\n\nA player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.",

With their greedy eyes on RollerGames' mega prize money, they've corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson \"Skeeter\" Bankhead, the games' beloved commissioner.\nYou and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles . . . through six stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous land-slides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum.\nIf your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double whammy slams.\nIt's a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter's life, and for the good of RollerGames. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball bearings into bullets.",

      "Description": "Rolling Thunder is a run and gun/action arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986 and licensed to Atari Games for US manufacture and distribution. It runs upon Namco System 86 hardware, and was later converted for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the Commodore 64, the Amstrad CPC, the Atari ST, the Commodore 64, and the Nintendo Family Computer. It was also featured in Namco Museum Encore.\n\nThe player takes control of \"Albatross\", a member of the WCPO's (World Crime Police Organization) \"Rolling Thunder\" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York City. Albatross must travel through two different segments or \"stories\", both comprised of five stages, for a total of ten game stages. On each stage, Albatross can enter doors, to hide and take cover from enemies, as well jump over to higher or lower floors with rails, including stairs. Albatross begins this game armed with a standard-issue pistol, which can be substituted with a fully automatic assault rifle that allows for continuous firing by holding down the firing button. Albatross can gain ammunition for either weapon, by entering doors which are marked \"bullets\" or \"arms\". Despite the presence of a life meter, Albatross can only take two physical hits from the enemy: a single hit drains half of the meter, and he will be killed instantly when struck by a projectile attack such as enemy bullets or lasers. (However, all bullets can be blocked by your own).",

      "Description": "The player takes control of a master, a general capable of commanding as many states as he can acquire, and, if successful, unifies China. As many as eight may play, but only one can succeed. There are five chronologically arranged scenarios. The first has China in its most disorganized period and the last has virtually all of China controlled by one of three generals. The precise requirements for success in each of these scenarios differs, but in all cases the goal is to rule as many states as possible. After the completion of any scenario but number five the game will automatically advance to the next. You may start the game at any scenario.\n\nKoei's Romance of The Three Kingdoms is based on an historical novel of the same name written in the Fourteenth Century, which was in turn based on a more serious official work of history by Ch'en Shou (233-297 A.D.), who chronicled major historical events in China from 220 to 265 A.D. Your master strives to unite China. You must enlist the help of others, fight well and negotiate shrewdly. Without able and loyal subordinates you will not be able to win the game. Choosing good people and winning their loyalty will not be easy and all the able and loyal subordinates in the world will not help if diplomatic and military resources are not used well.",

      "Description": "Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu is an RPG based around the anime and manga series known as Saint Seiya. It was developed and published by Bandai in 1987 for the Famicom.\n\nThe story of the game draws heavily from the first story arc of the series, from the beginning of the story to the fight with the Gold Saints. The game remains faithful to the original story while introducing some original elements. When the game came out, the story line was in the middle of the Gold Saints story arc. As a result, the last boss of the game is an original character. The actual final fight of the Gold Saints arc was carried over into this game's sequel, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen.\n\nThe gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes to transport the character from place to place where he may have to jump over obstacles and fight basic enemies, with a turn based combat system against bosses and other significant battles. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute his power, or Cosmos, to various attributes before each attack. Failure to do so typically results in no damage dealt to the opponent, and a lot of damage received. When Life is lost, the main character can be revived, but if all Cosmos is lost, then the game is over.",

This game stars Big Bird and co-stars Little Bird, and features Bert, Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Elmo. This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.",

Imagine needing every single megaton just to hold your own against a cybernetic army of metallic monstrosities. That's the guts of Shatterhand, the game that redefines hand-to-hand combat in the 21st century... along with all the standards for single-player action games for the NES. Seven levels of programmed adventure - you choose the action! State-of-the-art graphics featuring 8-direction scrolling! \"Anti-gravity\" levels force you to fight upside-down! Armed \"satellite robots\" assist you in battle. No arms on Earth can withstand the power in your hands!\n\nThis port is a localized version with differences such as different graphics for characters and items, different story and opening, and the most substantial change is Area C which is a carnival stage in the original but here it was replaced with a nuclear-submarine stage.",

      "Description": "In Shockwave you need to retrieve powerful crystals left behind by the Tarian race. The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.",

      "Description": "The aim is to shoot the discs on the screen so that you can acquire enough points to pass the clearing point score of that particular stage without your time or energy running out. You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200. Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points. The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.",

Enemy convoy identified on radar!!\n\nSILENT SERVICE, The Submarine Simulation, brings exciting action, great strategy, detailed graphics and an ultra-realistic simulation of a World War II U.S. submarine in the South Pacific.\n\nSILENT SERVICE's outstanding features include: all the critical battle stations 0 engine room, conning tower and ship's bridge; challenging and realistic combat versus single ships and heavily escorted convoys; and an infinite variety of situations using complete maps and charts for the entire South-west Pacific and a sophisticated and realistic attack plotting system.\n\nSILENT SERVICE is the most detailed and realistic submarine simulation for home computers. Player selected \"reality levels\" allow the player to customize complexity, and time scaling ensures that the actions and decisions are constantly required. SILENT SERVICE provides a wide selection of historical scenarios from individual attacks to patrol missions that bring challenge and fun to both the first time player and the experienced submarine veteran. Will you, as submarine captain, select a quiet patrol sector in the Marianas Islands, or choose the dangerous waters off the coast of Japan? Is the submerged daylight periscope attack best, or do you charge in on the surface at night using only radar bearing to guide you? Do you pick off the enemy with a single torpedo shot? These decisions and many more are yours to make as you take your place among the elite ranks of the SILENT SERVICE!",

The first player would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joins the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a \"goose\" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapon's powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game, and a \"goose\" could appear even during the fight with the end-of-level baddie.",

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough \"proof\" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are \"using\" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.",

      "Description": "Hop on your suped-up board and cruise into the wildest multi-event contest ever dreamed of by man or beast. Three of these twisted trials are cut from the concrete courses of pro competitions. Each pits you head to head with a friend, shooting ramps or racing downhill, while going for rock n' rolls, hand plants, aerials, rail slides and methods! Then blast into \"Mad Max on Wheels\", dueling to the death with Bionic Lester, the dirtiest dude in the jam and joust. And finally \"Skate and Destroy\", a challenge that'll turn you into a Samurai skater, karate chopping your way through a tough alley filled with thugs, trash and unmentionable traffic hazards. So squirt a little oil onto your ball bearings, and prepare to Skate or Die!",

      "Description": "The NES Port of Sky Kid. You are the legendary Red Baron, flying a plane through a horizontal side-scrolling scenery set during World War I. To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.\n\nYou can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.",

      "Description": "Sky Shark (released in Japan as \"Hi Sho Zame\", and in Europe as \"Flying Shark\")is a military-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game in which players take control of the titular biplane through five increasingly difficult levels in order to defeat an assortment of military enemy forces like tanks, battleships, airplanes and artillery as the main objective. The title initially appears to be very standard, as players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a runway is reached. Players have only two weapons at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen's height and three bombs.\n\nThe bombs are powerful weapons capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius. Various items are scattered through every stage that appear by destroying certain enemies: Shooting down colored waves of enemy planes spawn items like \"S\" power-up icons, point bonuses and extra lives. Certain enemies on the ground spawn \"B\" icons that increases the player's bomb stock when destroyed.\nEvery time the player lands at a runway beyond the first takeoff, the amount of bombs multiply 3000 points to the player's total score.\n\nPlayers are given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 50000 points and thereafter. The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the plane's firepower to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Completing the last stage restarts the game with the second loop increasing in difficulty.\n\nIn April 2020, M2 announced a new version of Flying Shark as part of their M2 ShotTriggers publishing label. It was first announced to be released on the Nintendo Switch.",

Serving as a standalone sequel to Metal Gear, it was released in North America and the PAL region, capitalising on the international success of the NES version. Notably, this instalment was created without the involvement of series creator Hideo Kojima. Meanwhile, Kojima went on to develop a separate sequel for the MSX2 titled Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, which debuted later in the same year in Japan.",

In the background, landmarks unique to Italy are shown (i.e., Leaning Tower of Pisa) and the structures using Roman architecture (i.e., the Colosseum) are shown while the player competes at the six events. A majority of the game seems to be ported from the Commodore 64 video game Alternative World Games by Gremlin Interactive.",

The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy-filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon than the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.",

After the most powerful spacecraft in the known Universe, the Golden Warpship, is disassembled by a band of ruthless Space Pirates and scattered throughout the galaxy, Solar Jetman is tasked with rebuilding the ship to its former glory. Aided only by the gargantuan Federation Mothership for refuelling, Jetman will have to explore twelve labyrinthine planets solo in his Jetpod, where opposition is hidden inside every cavern and beyond every crater. With survival running as thin as his fuel, Solar Jetman will need to ward off every potential invasion and escape with the Golden Warpship intact – only then can he face off against his largest interstellar foe yet!\n\nSolar Jetman was re-released as part of the Rare Replay Collection on Xbox One.",

      "Description": "The game is a 2-D sidescrolling platformer. The screen scrolls automatically, only stopping to fight major enemies. The screen features six continuous platforms that occasionally feature small gaps. Sonson and Tonton walk automatically across these platforms. Pressing up or down will cause them to jump up or down to the next platform. Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their stalves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.\n\nPower-ups come in the form of various fruits which produce points (with enough points giving the player an extra life). Gathering certain fruit will cause all enemies currently on a screen to turn into point-bearing fruits. Walking across certain platforms will randomly cause a bamboo shoot to sprout, yielding many extra points.\n\nIt is possible to play the game co-operatively with partner who plays as TonTon (who is Zhu Wuneng in the original story).",

      "Description": "The object of this video game is to successfully launch and fly one of NASA's historic Space Shuttles. Gameplay is composed of several different types of missions, each broken up into short mini-games.\nThe first part of the game requires the player to activate oxygen and hydrogen pumps as well as get additional crew members into the shuttle within a strict time limit by moving an elevator up and down and avoiding moving bumpers. Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space by performing quick time events that correspond to particular shuttle launch maneuvers such as booster rocket separation. Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations. A cosmonaut from the Soviet Union must also be rescued in the game.\nFinally, the player must land the shuttle by again performing Quick Time Events that correspond to landing maneuvers before finally landing at Edwards Air Force Base.",

Some puzzle solving (like finding a key) is necessary to beat some levels. Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles.\n\nAlthough hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.",

The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.",

      "Description": "The NES port of Spy Hunter, a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.",

Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance). Traps can be disarmed with objects found in rooms (a water bucket from a firebox on the wall will disarm the bomb in the prior example). When all the items are together in the secret briefcase, head for the airport door.",

Stack-Up is one of two games in Nintendo's Robot Series, the other being Gyromite (Robot Gyro in Japan). While Gyromite is a pack-in game with the R.O.B. itself and therefore comes with all the parts needed to play the game, Stack-Up comes in a large box containing additional bases and colored discs. The game's retail box comes with many small, plastic parts, which may contribute to difficulty in maintaining a complete set. Stack-Up is considered by collectors to be one of the rarest first-party games for the NES.",

In the game, the player pilots a starship called the Final Star, while shooting various enemies and destroying enemy structures for points.\n\nUnlike later vertical scrolling shooters, like Toaplan's Twin Cobra, the Final Star had only two levels of weapon power, and no secondary weapons like missiles and/or bombs. Each stage in the game was named after a letter of the Greek alphabet. In certain versions of the game, there is an additional level called \"Infinity\" (represented by the infinity symbol) which occurs after Omega, after which the game repeats indefinitely.",

Acclaim picked up the rights to release the game in the United States and changed the title.\n\nThe gameplay is heavily based on Atari's original Star Raiders concept. Another Famicom game built on this concept is Namco's Star Luster, which many players regard as the better quality game out of the two. Star Voyager is a first-person shooter from inside the cockpit of a spaceship. The player navigates through different quadrants contained in a galactic map. Different sections of the ship can sustain damage, but this damage can be repaired by visiting a space station.",

      "Description": "This game is based entirely on the first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope. The opening of the game features an animated cinematic of the opening scene of the film. After that the player takes control of Luke Skywalker, driving the landspeeder across Tatooine in search of R2-D2.\n\nLuke Skywalker explores various locations throughout Tatooine, fighting numerous enemies including Jawas and Stormtroopers. The game features many locations from the movie including the Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley where Luke meets Han Solo for the first time. This section of the game features a classic 8-bit rendition of the \"Cantina Band\" theme as played by the fictitious band, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, in the feature film. The game also contains many famous lines from the movie including Obi-Wan Kenobi's plea to Luke to join him in his trip to Alderann and Han Solo's description of the smell from the Death Star's trash compactor.\n\nThe player eventually lands on the Death Star and has to destroy the tractor beam to escape. The game also features first person segments of piloting the Millenium Falcon through that Asteroid field that was once Alderaan, and shooting down Tie Fighters in both the Millenium Falcon and an X-Wing fighter. The finale of the game features a top down view of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing flying through the Death Star trenches. After the player successfully fires a torpedo into the Death Star's exposed exhaust port, a cinematic of the Death Star exploding and Luke Skywalker being awarded a medal on Yavin IV is shown.\n\nThe game featured the characters Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, R2-D2, and C-3PO. The game however does not feature Darth Vader or Chewbacca, both of whom are major characters in the film.",

It was preceded by a version for the Atari 2600 and succeeded by Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back for the SNES.\n\nThe NES version was released the same year as JVC's Super Star Wars for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. As Empire was released towards the end of the NES's lifecycle, a corresponding sequel to the film Return of the Jedi was never developed, nor released.\n\nA version of the game was released for the Game Boy. That product was reprinted and distributed by several publishers over the course of three years.\"",

      "Description": "Sunday Funday: The Ride is a Christian video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Wisdom Tree, formerly a subsidiary label of Color Dreams, in 1995. The game was the last to be released by any company for the American NES. Like all Wisdom Tree games, Sunday Funday was not officially licensed by Nintendo. According to the game's instruction manual, the player controls a skateboarding hero who is late for Sunday school. In the game, the hero must use his skateboard and any objects he finds, such as balloons, grapefruits, and newspapers, to defeat bullies, clowns, and businessmen who are attempting to impede his path to Sunday school. The Sunday Funday game cartridge included two features other than the game itself - an arcade-style game titled Fish Fall and a sing-a-long of a song by Christian pop band 4Him. Sunday Funday is a ripped-off version of Menace Beach, also released by Color Dreams, excepting a few graphics and a complete story change. While the hero in Menace Beach fights ninjas and evil clowns on his way to rescue his girlfriend from Demon Dan, the hero in Sunday Funday fights bullies and businessmen on his way to Sunday school. Additionally, the hero carries a bible in Sunday Funday but not in Menace Beach. Finally, in Menace Beach, the hero's girlfriend appears wearing less and less clothing between levels, but she is replaced by a fully clothed Sunday school teacher in Sunday Funday.",

      "Description": "Super Cars is a top-view racing game from Gremlin Interactive, who later produced the Lotus series of games. Stylistically, the game is influenced by Super Sprint.\n\nThere are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on temporary handling and power upgrades, plus armour plating and front/rear shooting missiles that can knock out other racers. The player must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game.\n\nThe car can be upgraded throughout the game via the shop section. The player is given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman - with the right combination, the price will drop.",

      "Description": "answering reverse trivia questions in trademark Jeopardy! fashion-- i.e., the host provides the answer and a player has to provide the questions. As many of 4 human players can participate, with the remaining slots filled by the computer. Competition takes place in quarter-final, semi-final, and final round modes.\n\nA player will select a question from one of 6 categories. The game gives the answer to the question and the players use their controllers to buzz in. At that point, a player has 80 seconds to spell out the question (and the computer has already provided the \"What is...\" question preamble). In the player gets the question wrong, that player loses money and the remaining players have an opportunity to buzz in.",

      "Storyline": "One evening, Mario had a strange dream. He dreamt of a long, long stairway leading up to a door. As soon as the door opened, he was confronted with a world he had never seen before spreading out as far as his eyes could see. When he strained his ears to listen, he heard a faint voice saying, \"Welcome to Subcon, the land of dreams. We have been cursed by Wart and we are completely under his evil spell. We have been awaiting your arrival. Please defeat Wart and return Subcon to its natural state. The curse Wart has put on you in the real world will not have any effect upon you here. Remember, Wart hates vegetables. Please help us!\"\n\nAt the same time this was heard, a bolt of lightning flashed before Mario’s eyes. Stunned, Mario lost his footing and tumbled upside down. He awoke with a start to find himself sitting up in his bed. To clear his head, Mario talked to Luigi, Toad and Princess Peach about the strange dream he had. They decided to go to a nearby mountain for a picnic.\n\nAfter arriving at the picnic area and looking at the scenery, they see a small cave nearby. When they enter this cave, to their great surprise, there’s a stairway leading up, up and up. It is exactly like the one Mario saw in his dream. They all walk together up the stairs and at the top, find a door just like the one in Mario’s dream. When Mario and his friends, in fear, open the door, to their surprise, the world that he saw in his dream spreads out before them!",

The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.",

      "Description": "TaleSpin is a scrolling shooter video game based on the Disney television series TaleSpin. The game was developed by Capcom for the NES in 1991 and was ported to the Game Boy in 1992. The Game Boy version is essentially a slightly stripped-down version of the game.\n\nThe NES version of the game was included in The Disney Afternoon Collection compilation for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in April 2017.\n\nThe gameplay consists of maneuvering Baloo's plane \"The Sea Duck\" through each level, fending off incoming enemies and avoiding obstacles. Items can be collected for extra lives or to add to the total cash score. The plane can be rotated upside to traverse back through the level, but only on horizontally scrolling areas. At the end of each level, the player is required to fight a boss enemy by repeatedly shooting its weak points. After beating a level, the player has the option to buy upgrades for Baloo's plane with the money collected, before proceeding to the next level. In bonus levels the player controls Kit on an airfoil to pop balloons for bonus points.",

      "Description": "Target: Renegade is a scrolling beat'em up (or flip-screen on certain versions) computer game released on the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum systems in the late 1980s by Ocean Software on their \"Imagine\" label, as well as a Nintendo Entertainment System version published by Taito. The game is a sequel to Renegade and was followed by Renegade 3. When acquiring the license to convert the original arcade game Renegade to home computers, Ocean acquired the option to produce and release their own home-computer-only sequels to the game, and Target Renegade was the first of these sequels.\n\nOn most formats, the game caters for one or two players and concerns itself with the adventures of a streetfighter (or a pair of identical streetfighters) known only as \"Renegade\", who seek(s) revenge against a local crime kingpin named \"Mr. Big\" for murdering his or their brother Matt. The player character varies, depending on the format, but is usually represented as topless apart from a leather vest and wearing jeans.\n\nRegardless of the format, the cover of the game and the title screen (as seen on the image to the right) portrays a topless street fighter performing a flying kick through a window. In keeping with video game box art and advertising of the era, the character shown in this illustration bears little relation to any character in the game itself. The actual picture is based on Martial Arts Legend Joe Lewis from the cover of his book The World's Greatest Fighter Teaches You How To Master Bruce Lee's Fighting System, but has been adjusted so as to fit in with the character of Renegade.\n\nThe game comprises five levels, though details of enemies and weapons vary from one version to another (the NES version in particular is more like Double Dragon than the home computer versions). The NES and C64 versions of the game do not have a two-player co-operative mode.",

      "Storyline": "Shredder kidnaps April and gains the Life Transformer Gun, a weapon capable of returning Splinter to his human form. In order to save April, the turtles (Leo, Mikey, Donny and Raph) embark on the streets of New York to confront the Foot Clan. While traversing the sewers, the turtles encounter Bebop, a mutated pig, and Rocksteady, a mutant rhino. Though the turtles defeat Bebop, Rocksteady escapes with April O’Neil. The turtles then chase Rocksteady to an abandoned warehouse, fight him, and rescue April. After disabling bombs in the Hudson River dam, Shredder captures Splinter, so the turtles give chase in the Party Wagon. Hot in pursuit, the turtles scour the city and eventually find that Splinter is held captive by the robotic Mecaturtle on a skyscraper rooftop. After the turtles save Splinter, Shredder escapes in a helicopter. The turtles give chase, tracking him to JFK airport, where they encounter Big Mouser. After defeating Big Mouser, the turtles head to Shredder's secret Foot Clan base in the South Bronx via the Turtle Blimp. Once there, they locate and battle the Technodrome underground. The turtles descend into the Technodrome's reactor and ultimately defeat Shredder. With the Life Transformer Gun, the turtles help Splinter return to his human form. With a tough mission accomplished, the turtles and April celebrate with a pizza.",

Once the ship has multiple sections, the player may also split it, allowing it to fire in multiple directions.\n\nThe player begins with three lives and it is possible to play with either one or two players.",

This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges.",

Plucky rides a bumper car. Hamton rides a tricky train trip. Babs rides the rollercoaster. Furrball dodges Sweetie as he goes for a wild log ride. And Buster faces the thrills and chills of the Funhouse.\nEach ride costs a certain amount of tickets, but as the player racks up points on the various rides, more tickets are earned. Eventually, when enough tickets have been earned, they can be saved until the player has enough to afford the entrance fee to the Funhouse, where Buster Bunny must then navigate numerous obstacles before squaring off with the \"Secret Admirer\", who turns out to be Montana Max.\nJust like in the first game, Roderick Rat is there to try to interfere, plus other villain characters. Other Tiny Toon characters also make appearances in varying degrees.",

      "Description": "In the year 2050 the Earth has been attacked by the villainous Raggosians and it is your job to save the planet! You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.",

You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.",

High above hostile waters your mission is to defend the task force from enemy attack. Suddenly, bogeys flash onto your radar. They're everywhere, diving toward you at Mach 2. Only a second to react, you go to guns and arm missiles. Your heart pounds and palms sweat as you blast into the dogfight with cannons blazing. Tracers zip past your engines. Shells shatter your senses. Now it's just you against them. And to survive you'll need more than speed and firepower. You'll need guts and instinct. You'll need to be a \"TOP GUN\" pilot!",

In order to do this, Quaid must go through level after level of beating up bad guys that get in his way.\n\nSome of the levels differ in gameplay, and range between action and driving scenes. The action scenes mainly require you to collect some items before leaving the level. You have only one chance to complete the current level, which means that if your energy is lost, the game ends. Energy is lost if you are attacked by an obstacle, or if you are shot at by an enemy. You can gain more energy by either collecting some pills or a heart, depending on the platform.",

Don't become Trog's Stone Age feast! Instead, use your reflexes and wits racing through 50 fun-filled islands, packed with dino-mite action and surprises. You'll witness the greatest inventions of all time: fire, the wheel, the pogo stick (the pogo stick?) - all invented by Trog to catch his dinner - you! Just watch out for the Tar Pits... sticky business. You've got special pick-ups to keep that carnivorous chow hound in check, like pineapples that turn you into a ferocious Trog-munching T-Rex. It's like this: either you save the Dinos... or you're extinct!",

      "Description": "The NES port of Trojan. The game's controls consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons. Similarly to Kung-Fu Master or Rush'n Attack, the player jumps by holding the joystick upwards instead of having a dedicated jump button like other side-scrolling action games. Instead, one button is used to swing the sword at enemies and the other button is used to hold the shield to block enemy attacks, including projectiles such as throwing knives and arrows. The shield can be held towards the player while standing or crouching, as well as upwards vertically and diagonally. Some enemies will throw magic balls which will cause the player to lose their sword and shield if they block. During these instances, the player will fight barehanded, with the sword and shield buttons used to punch and kick respectively. The sword and shield will appear on-screen after some point, allowing the player to recover their weapon. Other power-ups includes floating hearts that will restore the player's health and jumping spots where the player can jump higher than usual.",

The one caveat is that the players troll has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, the player has to bounce across a paint can that will change your trolls hair to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time.",

The game's world comprises interconnected areas which consist of outdoor sections, caves, water, and other thematic places with platform structures and wandering enemies. Similarly to The Dragon's Trap, the player is theoretically able to explore this world from the beginning; however, many areas are too hazardous or impossible to traverse when the player controls only one character with his limited abilities.\n\nThis European version of the game has some alterations when compared with the original Japanese release such as a different story, characters' names and sprites being changed, and bird enemies dropping weights instead of feces.",

      "Description": "The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.",

      "Description": "The Uncanny X-Men is an overhead-view action game. Players commence by selecting two X-Men from the roster, with the second controlled by another player or the computer. They then choose one of five levels, including a practice level. The objective in each level is to reach the concealed 'command centre' and demolish it. All X-Men share similar abilities, allowing movement in any direction, jumping, and attacking. Half of the characters (Storm, Iceman, Cyclops) possess long-range attacks, while the other half (Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus) need to engage enemies in close combat. Each X-Man can endure a specific number of hits before being defeated. If both X-Men fall in battle, players can select two more to attempt the level again until all X-Men are used.\n\nPower-ups include an \"S\" that stops time, temporary invincibility, and a health restore. Additionally, a Magnet power-down (symbolizing Magneto) temporarily immobilizes the X-Men.",

Here you have it, the most excellent beach volleyball game ever! Locals say kicking the butt of a computer controlled team is never easy without a lot of practice. You haven't seen anything until you challenge a friend head to head in competitive double player action mode. Way rad beach volleyball action, blazing 8-bit graphics and killer tunes. That's what VENICE BEACH VOLLEYBALL is all about!",

In driving stages Hart's vehicle can accelerate or slow down and fire his weapon straight ahead. During side-scrolling sequences, Hart can jump, duck, climb or use his selected weapon. Weapons that can be selected include a Katana sword, a pistol and a grenade-type weapon. These weapons feature limited ammunition with the exception of the katana. Power-ups include ammunition, coins, and health. In rail-shooting stages, similar to Operation Wolf, Hart can shoot enemies with his gun or throw grenades and pick up items by shooting at them.",

      "Description": "The game begins by asking the player(s) to choose a difficulty level, not only making the enemies more difficult and the players weaker, but higher difficulties start the players in a later set of levels (called \"galaxies\") and with some powerups. The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less. If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station.\n\nOccasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level.\n\nBetween levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost.\n\nThe arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt. A later version of the game was released which eliminated the contest levels and stars.",

Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.",

The quiet, woodlands community has now been turned upside-down by these horrifying events. Wario has now named the woods after himself, and peaceful creatures are not welcome. Toad, the Mushroom Kingdom hero, has decided to travel to Wario's Woods and put an end to Wario's evil reign of terror. Toad knows that, with the sprites help, he will be able to rid the forest of Mario's twisted nemesis. Thankfully, the sprites are able to create bombs. It's Toad's job to line up the bombs with the enemies of the woods, thus defeating those evil creatures. By clearing more and more of the woods, Toad steps ever close to the ultimate challenge of facing Wario.",

      "Description": "Wheel of Fortune was the first game based on the TV game show for the NES. It was developed by Rare and released on the same month as their NES Jeopardy! adaptation. Rare would follow it up with two more NES adaptations of the show: Wheel of Fortune: Junior Edition and Wheel of Fortune: Family Edition.\n\nIt follows the rules of the show, where people spin a wheel and then try to solve a hangman puzzle, either guessing a consonant or spending their reward money to buy a vowel. Up to three human players can play via a pass-and-play system. Players must input their answers within a time limit using the in-game text parser.",

The players take turns spinning a wheel that has designated money amounts in most spaces, but can also bankrupt the player in the wheel lands on the wrong space. A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed-- the 5 English vowels can be purchased using a player's earnings.",

Your job is to search the city for clues, items and punchlines to jokes which will be your only defense should the Weasels catch up to poor Roger. Except for these Weasels (and birds flying overhead), Roger is more or less invincible as a toon. That means for most of the gameplay, he will be ignored. Should the Weasels appear in an area with you however (with an alarm sounding as they get close), Roger will go bug-eyed and try to run away. It is then up to Eddie to keep the Weasels away from Roger or engage in knock-knock jokes should they happen to catch him.",

A player on your team draws something on the big game board, and you must work out what it represents. They will be common expressions depicted literally, such as 'bright idea' showing a light bulb over somebody's head, and 'cabin fever' as a rickety building next to a man with a thermometer in his mouth.",

      "Storyline": "After the defeat of Werdna, Trebor sent his remaining army to clean out the rest of the maze. Upon extermination of every monster, Trebor decided to make certain that Werdna (who is aided by the dark arts) would never be able to return. Attempting to use the amulet much like Werdna did, Trebor was able to slightly alter the structure of the labyrinth below him. He ordered guards to forever patrol the passages of the dungeon to make sure that Werdna would not be able to return from the dead. So possessed did he become with the concept of Werdna's return, the overlord soon drove himself to the point of suicide. Rumors say that his ghost still walks the levels of the maze below the castle looking for Werdna. With Trebor dead, the power of the city was once again divided between the High Council and the Royal Family. Hailed as heroes, your party was offered one of the highest honors in the kingdom.\n\nIt's been about two years since the death of Trebor, and now another crisis has erupted.\n\nThe city of Llylgamyn had always been under the protection of a powerful artifact known as the Staff of Gnilda. The staff surrounded the city with a magic field that protected it from evil. Anyone who wished harmful intent for the city of Llylgamyn would find themselves unable to enter it's gates. While those who wished it no harm could come and go as they pleased. This seemed to provide the perfect defense, however there was a way around it. The staff could only stop evil from entering the city, but if evil was born inside the city walls, that person was unaffected by the staff.\n\nOf course it is known Werdna was native to the kingdom, but little did anyone know there was another dark soul born in the city walls. His name was Davalpus. Davalpus called upon the darkest of monsters; aided by the agents of evil he stormed the castle slew the royal family. Only Prince Alavik and his sister Princess Margda escaped. They knew there was only one hope of defeating Davalpus and that was with the staff itself. The Staff of Gnilda is located in the underground temple beneath the Royal Castle. It was placed there by a legendary hero known only as the Knight of Diamonds. In order to handle the staff a person must be dressed from head to toe in the armor of that legendary knight. The armor is scattered throughout the temple and is heavily guarded. Entering the temple undetected, The Prince was able to retrieve all of the armor, and eventually the staff as well.\n\nPrepared for battle, the Prince confronted Davalpus in an epic battle. As the Prince landed the killing blow, Davalpus uttered a curse so powerful that the castle was reduced to rubble leaving the Temple of Gnilda exposed. With a flash of light both the prince and the body of Davalpus were gone. The staff was gone as well. On that day the god Gnilda spoke to the people of the city: \"I have found this city unworthy of my protection and have hidden my staff within the depths of my temple. If the staff is sought out and returned to my main chamber, I will once again place the city under my protection. This is the word of Gnilda.\n\nNews of this event spread across the kingdom, the city was vulnerable without the staff to protect it. Who could be powerful enough to enter the temple and bring the staff back?\n\nThe High Council of sages have turned to you. They remember the deeds of your past and implore you to help the city once again. If you are successful you will be granted royal honors and riches beyond your imagination.\n\nYou have accepted.",

      "Description": "The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.\n\nThe first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.\n\nThe player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.",

      "Storyline": "The land of Llylgamyn is the basis of many legends. It is the center of commerce throughout the land, and home of the academy where some of the bravest warriors are trained. In it's early days it was a monarchy ruled by the royal family, but as time passed the power shifted to aristocrats and theocrats, and eventually the royal family became more symbolic then anything else.\n\nUnder a more democratic system, the High Council of Sages appointed an Overlord to govern over the kingdom. With that, the power of the royal family diminished almost completely. The Overlord was a former warrior of the realm, and a local hero. His name was Trebor. At first everything seemed well, but as time went by Trebor's thirst for power began to show. He began searching for ways to expand his rule. He learned of an ancient amulet held in a forgotten temple somewhere outside of the kingdom. Eventually, through unknown means he was able to find it's hidden location. He gathered his best men and sent them on a mission to retrieve this legendary artifact. They returned successful. Trebor, however, was not the only person who wanted this artifact. Only hours behind him in reaching it's original destination was the evil wizard Werdna (arch-enemy of Trebor). When Werdna discovered that someone had found the amulet before him he grew very angry. Using his magic he was able to discover it's new location. That evening the Wizard made his assault on Overlord's Castle. Making himself invisible he was able to sneak past Trebor's guards. He found the overlord sitting in his throne room with a group of sages studying the amulet. Werdna cast a powerful spell that made Trebor and everyone in his immediate vicinity frozen with fear. With Trebor unable to move, Werdna plucked the amulet right from his hands and left the castle.\n\nWerdna knew that once the Trebor regained his senses he would be prime suspect. He couldn't return to his tower, he needed a new hiding place. That's when he was struck with a brilliant idea. Werdna decided to use to amulet to make a new home right beneath the city of Llylgamyn! There was enough underground mining activity already, he should go unnoticed. Upon the thought of this very plan, the amulet began to glow. Suddenly there was tremendous earthquake, and in a flash Werdna found himself in a giant ten level labyrinth in the ground below the city. Summoning monsters to be his allies Werdna explored his way to the lowest depths and made a home where he would be able to study the powers of the amulet undisturbed.\n\nAfter losing the amulet and discovering the existence of the mysterious maze beneath his city, Trebor became unhinged. His madness grew daily, all he could think of was getting his amulet back. He called for the greatest warriors in the realm to enter the maze and find Werdna, but the monsters grew greater in numbers and they began to spread to even the highest depths of the maze.\n\nA year after the discovery of the maze, Trebor had managed to secure the first four floors. Most of the warriors who tried to journey deeper were never seen again, those that were returned with their minds warped, speaking of demons and dark magic. Trebor ordered the passages to the deeper layers of the maze to be magically sealed, thus preventing these creatures from making their way to the town. He also ordered that traps be set on the first three layers. Upon completion, Trebor declared the maze his own personal proving grounds. New cadets enrolled in the training academy would be offered the opportunity to brave the maze. Those that could find the secret he had hidden for them would be rewarded. Trebor decided he could use the maze as a test, those that would be able to able to make their way to the fourth floor would be deemed worthy and told the truth about Werdna and the amulet. They would be given the chance to go deeper into the maze. If they could return with the amulet, they would be inducted as members of Trebor's Personal Guard.\n\nIt has been five years since the disappearance of the amulet, and this time it is your characters that have volunteered to challenge the maze.\n\nThis is where it all begins.",

One of the kidnapped is a student of the Black Manta's sensei, Taro.\n\nThe Black Manta has many powers, which he gets after beating a level. The player can choose which power to use by pressing start. These powers can help the Black Manta defeat enemies and bosses more quickly. The Black Manta can save kidnapped children hidden throughout each level, however, it plays no role in completing the game and does not warrant any kind of special bonus.\n\nPart of the last level is seen through a first person perspective. Towards the end of this stage, the Black Manta has to defeat one of the bosses from the previous levels before he goes face-to-face with El Toro himself.",

However, the game presents many very important gameplay changes compared to the previous one, affecting especially the movements and the combat. Moving around the world map involves encounters with enemies that take place on a side-scrolling playfield rather than the top-down perspective for which the series became known.",

With the help of Impa, Zelda's nursemaid, Link learns that this mark is the key to unlock a secret room where Princess Zelda lies sleeping. When young, Princess Zelda was given knowledge of the Triforce of power which was used to rule the kingdom of Hyrule, but when a magician unsuccessfully tried to find out about the Triforce from Zelda, he put her into an eternal sleep. In his grief, the prince placed Zelda in this room hoping she may wake some day. He ordered all female children in the royal household to be named Zelda from this point on, so the tragedy would not be forgotten. Now, to bring Princess Zelda back, Link must locate all the pieces of the Triforce which have been hidden throughout the land.",

      "Description": "IF YOU LIKE FIGHTING DIRTY, YOU'RE GONNA DIG ZEN!\n\nThe greatest environmental disaster in human history is about to hit your backyard. But you're not backing down, because you're Zen, a cold-blooded Ninja warrior who's come to Earth to clean the clock of Lord Contaminous and his crud-loving cronies.\n\nBut wasting these slimeballs won't be easy. Because they'll spew forth the most hazardous graphics ever to wreak havoc on your NES. We're talking horizontal, vertical and 3/4 view scrolling that will give you a whole new perspective on acid rain, oil spills and ozone-ravaging smog. And wait till you see the fluid character movements. They're hotter than a uranium-oozing nuclear meltdown!\n\nThere are 12 total levels, each with its own ecological enemies, toxic traps and pollution-fighting objectives. You'll battle oil rig fires, trying to save trapped workers. Use your Photon-Stick to zap gaseous garbage men on a high-speed plutonium mining car ride. Vertical jump through two separate screens to reach a venomous vixen who's single-handedly scorching the rainforests. And spin kick Smogger, a smoked-out scum of the Earth.\n\nFinally, try to survive a rescue mission stage. Rack up points in the bonus recycling level. And slash through 6 subgames that will lead you to the feet of Lord Contaminous, who you must dispose of before he trashes every living thing on the face of the Earth.\n\nFor 1 Ninja Master.",

These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura.
