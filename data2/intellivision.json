      "Description": "Intellivision Backgammon is identical with the board game. Backgammon is a game played by two players (the computer can be one of the players). Each player has 15 pieces. The object of the game is to be the first to move all your pieces completely around and finally off the board. Moving your pieces off the board is called \"bearing off\". The first player to bear off all his pieces is the winner. Each player moves in a direction beginning from his opponent's Home Table and coming around to his own Home Table. Thus one player always moves clockwise and the other always counterclockwise. You can play against the computer at two skill levels - one for beginners or intermediate, another for experts - or two players can compete against each other. It displays the American Backgammon Players Association (ABPA) logo.",

Engage enemy planes in dogfights to the death! \n \nDue to the popularity (especially with APh and Mattel programmers) of the Biplanes game in the Triple Action cartridge, APh proposed this one-player version. A prototype was shown to Mattel with scrolling mountain terrain and targets that could be bombed. The plane graphics, sound effects and flight control were lifted directly from Biplanes. (Enemy planes, which would have presented an artificial intelligence-programming challenge, were not included in the prototype but promised for the finished game.) \n \nMarketing (not as crazy about Biplanes as the programmers) chose not to release the game and it went unfinished. \n \nFUN FACT: A nice touch is that the second you lose control and smash into the side of a mountain, another biplane flies on-screen, cheerfully circling the crash site, trailing a banner displaying your score.",

      "Description": "In Astrosmash you control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen; your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the various incoming meteors, bombs, and other objects. Points are earned for destroying objects, while points are lost for letting them get past you. Meteors are the most common item you need to defend yourself against. They come in various sizes and colors, and some even split into two smaller meteors when shot.\n\nMixed in with the meteors are white spinning bombs. While letting a meteor get past you will only lower your score, you have to shoot the spinners. If one gets past, you will lose a life. On the more difficult levels, ufo's and guided missiles will also appear occasionally and attempt to destroy your canon.",

The various gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.",

First you need to select a destination which features a lot of targets. The further the target is from your home base, the more points you can earn, but with more ground to cover there will be more enemy fighters blocking the target and more fuel will be needed. Once a destination is set, you need to stock your plane with bombs and fuel, then take off! You will now have a first person point of view from the plane and can control which of several views is active. When trying to bomb targets, you will be looking straight down from the bombay doors. When you hear a voice announce incoming enemy planes, you need to switch the view to one of the guns and defend yourself. Lastly you can have a view from the cockpit to control the plane. If your fuel runs low, or your plane takes too much damage, you can fly back to your home base for repairs and then take off again to bomb as many targets as you can!",

In order to find the code which disarms the bomb, the player has to repair the various circuits in order to fix the display. By selecting a square on the code number display, the player will be brought to the corresponding circuit which can be repaired using cutters, pliers, and soldering iron. The player's partner, Frank, will guide through the repairs by telling the player what needs to be done, in what order repairs should be performed, and by helping the player position the tools. Depending on the circuit, the player may need to cut out parts or replace parts (spare parts are located at the top of the screen). If the player use an incorrect replacement part, or perform the repairs in the wrong order, the player will lose time or even cause the bomb to explode.\n\nOn the more difficult skill levels, circuit parts may even overheat and cause a fire; luckily, the player also have a fire extinguisher with you to deal with this situation! When enough circuits have been repaired, the player can decipher the code, enter it into the computer, and the bomb will be disarmed (an incorrect guess will cause it to explode, however). The player may choose to have a one, two, or three digit code to guess and several difficulty levels are available.",

      "Description": "Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a \"knockout\") or two minutes have elapsed (a \"decision\"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.\nWhile the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the \"ropes\" and \"juggling\" him back and forth between alternate punches.",

The arcade version was available as both a dedicated board and as part of Data East's DECO Cassette System. It was distributed in North America by Bally Midway. The goal is to drive to the end of a level while bumping enemy vehicles into the sides of the track and jumping over large obstacles such as bodies of water.\n\nThe arcade game was a commercial success in Japan and North America. The game was ported to the Atari 2600, Intellivision, ColecoVision, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Sharp X1. The Famicom version of Burnin' Rubber was published as \"Buggy Popper\" in Japan in 1986.",

You control a can of bug spray at the bottom of the screen, and you need to defend yourself from the swarms of incoming bees. The bees start at the top of the screen, and fly their way back and forth, slowly heading towards the bottom of the screen. If they reach the ground, they will pollinate the flowers there which causes them to grow and will restrict movement of your spray can. When you shoot a bee, it will turn into a honeycomb. The honeycombs will cause the bees to head towards the ground even faster, since they will turn around when one is in their way. Your spray can is able to shoot the honeycombs, but if you leave them in place a hummingbird will fly around and eat the honey from them. The more honey the hummingbird eats, the more points you get. The game ends when all of your spray cans are destroyed by growing flowers.",

      "Description": "The goal of the game is to shoot at targets, while carefully avoiding running out of bullets. Three rows of targets scroll across the screen in alternating directions; these include rabbits, ducks, owls, and bonus items. If a duck target crosses the bottom row without being shot, it will come to life and begin flying down toward the player. Any ducks that reach the bottom of the screen in this manner will eat some of the player's bullets. Objects also periodically appear among the targets that will give the player extra bullets or points when hit. A spinning wheel with eight pipes sits above the rows of moving targets; these pipes and all targets must be shot in order to complete the round. At the end of each round, the player receives bonus points for all bullets remaining in his supply. He then plays a bonus round, where a large white bear with a target walks across the screen. Each time the bear is shot, it rears up for a second, then begins walking more quickly in the other direction. The object is to shoot the bear as many times as possible until it escapes off the screen. Following the bonus round, the next wave begins. Later bonus rounds add more bears to the screen. In higher levels, there are more duck targets and fewer extra bullet targets, putting a premium on accurate shooting. The game ends when the player runs out of bullets.",

The player takes the role of a red-nosed safari hunter who tries to catch an ape named \"Bongo\". The hunter seeks Bongo to exact revenge for an apparent practical joke in which Bongo set fire to the hunter's tent, giving him a literal \"hotfoot\". The game was named by Peter W. Gorrie who was the CFO of Sega at that time.",

When the Clone Master touches you, the game is over. \n \nNote: If you tag all of the clones without letting the Clone Master create a new clone, you're hosed.",

Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which can walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.",

As Dracula, the goal of this game is to stalk the streets at night, feeding on people walking the streets, or by luring them out of their homes. As Dracula bites his victims, his actions will call the attention of the local constable who will try to slow him down by driving a stake into him. Dracula can respond by either turning one of his victims into zombies to attack the police, or by transforming into a bat to escape capture. Even the forces of nature are against the vampire, as wolves will attack him on foot, and hawks will drag away his bat form. Dracula must feed on a certain number of victims and return to his tomb before sunrise, or he will not survive to feed another night.",

As the gorilla walks on, it will encounter a creature which has a math problem with it. You need to enter in the correct answer to the problem as quickly as possible. If you get the answer correct, your gorilla may continue on. If you get the answer wrong, then your gorilla must jump into the river. Your gorilla is unable to leave the river and continue on until you answer another math problem correctly. The goal is to correctly answer as many of the problems as you can in the shortest amount of time. The game includes eighteen different levels of difficulty which can be set individually for each player.",

      "Description": "Word Fun was developed in conjuction with the Children's Television Workshop, and features three different word based educational games. The games are:\n\nCrosswords:\nThis game is similar to Scrabble. Each player is given seven letters from which they need to form words on the game board. On each turn the player can create words either horizontally or vertically, and must use one (or more) of the existing letters on the board. Points are earned depending on the word created, and at the end of 20 turns the player with the most points wins!\n\nLetter Hunt:\nIn this game each player controls a monkey in a letter forest. Each monkey must collect letters from the forest to spell three words within the given time limit. When both monkeys are complete, points are awarded for the words spelled and the highest score wins!\n\nWord Rockets:\nIn this game the players control a rocket capable of collecting and shooting vowels upwards. On the top of the screen, various words which are missing vowels will float by and each player needs to try to fire an appropriate vowel into the empty space. The first player who can complete 50 words wins!",

Without his trident, Neptune is powerless.\n\nProteus, a member of Neptune's Court, longs to free the lovely mermaid. He sets out to find the missing pieces of the Trident. He roams land and sea, changing from a dolphin to a seagull and back again in order to deceive the mermaid's captors. Deadly trials confront Proteus -- octopuses, tangled beds of kelp, screaming flocks of black birds, even erupting volcanoes! But he fights on valiantly!",

You have to jump from one lily pad to the other and try to catch the insects which fly across the pond with your tongue. In doing that you have to be carfeul not to fall into the water since getting back to your lily pad will cost you valuable time. The frog who has caught the most insects after a three minute time limit has won the game. A nice touch is the changing of the times of day from morning through midday and afternoon to night time which makes it harder to see the oncoming insects.",

      "Description": "[Unfinished 1983] An arcade game. Carom your shots against the moving wall to fill in the pattern on the back grid. \n \nThis original game by Andy Sells looked great; it had a strong 3-D effect as the moving wall swept back and forth across the screen. But while Andy wanted to continue developing the game, management wanted to take advantage of his musical talents. (Shortly before coming to Mattel, his award-winning song \"You Love Love [More Than You Love Me]\" was recorded by the English group Buck's Fizz. Ask for it by name.) \n \nAndy was continually assigned to work on music and sound effects for other games, including Shark! Shark! and TRON Solar Sailer. He also co-developed the Intellivision sound development tool, Mr. Sound. Whenever he had a chance he returned to Grid Shock, but the game was never elevated to official status. \n \nWhile the game never made it onto the Intellivision release schedule, it was demonstrated as part of the Intellivision III product line. This was bogus; when the Intellivision III wasn't ready to be shown at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, regular Intellivision screens with particularly nice graphics were passed off as examples of the forthcoming system. Grid Shock was one of these; color packaging was even printed up for it. \n \nAfter C.E.S., Andy never had a chance to return to the game. His boss, Manager Russ Haft, left Mattel for Atari; Andy was tapped to take his place. A short time later, Andy, too, left for Atari and Grid Shock was abandoned.",

Black Bart has robbed the stagecoach, and you need to recover all of the stolen money within the given time limit! The money is located in various locations in a series of maze-like paths. The paths are broken up into tiles, and there is one tile missing so you can rearrange the maze by moving a tile into the empty space. As your character walks through the paths, you need to rearrange the tiles to make sure there is always a connected path in front of him (or you'll lose a life) and to guide him towards the money bags. When all of the money has been recovered, you move on to the next round. On the more difficult rounds, Black Bart will also be wandering around the maze trying to stop you! You should avoid him at all costs, unless you have first collected a star which gives your character temporary invincibility.",

When the race begins, the horses are speedier at the beginning, slower toward the end. They are different for speed at the starting gate, stamina, speed at the straight line, and for speed with different conditions of the race terrain. You (and the CPU too!) have the whip and the coax to spur a horse, and these tools could be useful to win a race even with a more tired horse.",

There is a radar screen too, that shows all the damages made by the terrorists, the fires extinguished and the enemies shut down. The terrorists hits can damage the engine, the navigation system, the cannons and the radar. The player can return to home base (Force Island) for repairs and refuelling, but only two times per mission (the 3rd time after eliminating all the fiends). The game, for 1 player, ends if the copter crashes.",

      "Description": "[Unreleased 1983] puzzle game -- move rows and columns of squares to line up matching colors. \n \nWhile experimenting with Intellivision graphics, someone in the Design & Development department came up with a kaleidoscopic effect using sequenced GRAM. VP of Applications Software Gabriel Baum liked the effect, dubbed Hypnotic Lights, and asked programmer Steve Roney (Space Spartans) to work it into a game. \n \nSteve's reaction was pretty much: yeah, right, what game? Marketing had a suggestion: something sort of kind of like a Rubik's Cube. That's what Steve sort of kind of gave them. But while Steve continued to tinker with it when not working on higher priority games (including B-17 Bomber, Aquarius Utopia and Space Shuttle), Hypnotic Lights was never elevated to \"official\" status.",

When you touch the right letter in the right order, you earn points, but touch a letter that doesn't belong and you lose them. If you collect letters out of order you don't earn as many points. On the higher levels you also have to dodge robots and satellites, which cost more points if you hit them.",

      "Description": "[Unreleased 1982] Land Battle is a two player war game which utilizes both strategic and tactical modes of play. Each player controls an array of forces with the objective of capturing or destroying his opponent's \"flag.\"\n\nPRODUCTION HISTORY\nThis wargame simulation took a long time in programming (officially 391 days, compared to 170 days for Night Stalker, begun at about the same time); when completed in mid-1982, Marketing was concerned that its design already looked dated.\n\nA second concern was that, due to the complexity of the game, it required more memory than an Intellivision contained; the cartridge would have to include 256 bytes of RAM onboard. Only USCF Chess had been approved for onboard RAM, an expensive proposition.\n\nWhen the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) was given the green light, Gabriel Baum, VP of Applications Software, proposed changing Land Battle to an ECS title; the ECS had an additional 2K of RAM available for cartridges. Marketing resisted this -- they still wanted Land Battle as a stand-alone game. Peggi Decarli was assigned to give the game a graphics makeover.\n\nAfter the makeover, Marketing still didn't find it visually interesting enough. By that time, wargame fanatic Steve Sents, having completed Deadly Discs, had started work on an ECS wargame called Desert Fox, which Marketing liked the looks of better. The decision was made to kill Land Battle and incorporate as much of its gameplay and programming as possible into the Desert Fox design.",

All of these maps show roads, towns, hills, lakes, forests, orchards, and fields, and these geographic features impose restrictions and necessitate clever planning on the part of the player.\n\nAt the beginning of the game each player has control of the following military resources:\n\n12 infantry\n3 armored personnel carriers\n2 tanks\n1 artillery piece\n2 bazookas\n2 mortars\n1 flag\n\nYou can capture opposing forces which subsequently become yours.\n\nIn order to wage an effective war, you must allocate your resources into patrols, direct the patrols across the map, encounter enemy patrols, fight battles, besiege towns, and eventually capture or destroy the enemy flag.",

The object of the game is to enter a maze and collect all the coins and, if possible, any other treasure that may appear. The thief must then exit the maze (a vault) without being apprehended by the Super D (policemen). The thief can close doorways within the maze in order to temporarily trap the Super D and allow him to keep his distance from them. Only two doors can be closed at a time.

However, the presence of a constantly moving locomotive complicates matters. The player controls the playfield and the aim is to guide the locomotive around the tracks to collect the passengers waiting at the stations located around the edges of the screen.\n\nThe player uses a joystick to slide a piece of the track into the vacant square. The locomotive is always moving, but the player has the option of making it move faster to get to the passengers more quickly by using a button next to the joystick. The player must avoid crashing the locomotive into the dead-end barricades (shown as a yellow 'X'), and also ensure that it does not run into the edge of the gap or a barrier at the playfield edge, either of which costs a life.",

Programmer Ron Surratt (Atari 2600 BurgerTime) and graphic artist Peggi Decarli (USCF Chess) drew up some initial concepts for the game (Ron's input was requested because he used to be a teacher), then Steve Ettinger was assigned as programmer. New-hire Joe Ferreira was added to train with Peggi as a graphics artist. Steve and Joe quickly became a strong design team, taking the concept from a barnyard to a carousel and making the game their own. By the time it was finished, however, Marketing decided that sales of Intellivoice units were too low to support such a \"specialty\" cartridge. Magic Carousel was shelved with the hope that a future increase in Intellivoice sales would justify the game's release. It never happened. \n \nSteve and Joe had proved themselves to be a formidable team, so they were chosen to design the top-secret experimental Intellivision game, Hover Force 3-D. \n \nEASTER EGG: Connect the twinkling stars above the carousel on the title screen to get SEE and JAF, Steve and Joe's initials.",

      "Description": "Major League Baseball is an action baseball game for two players. The game follows most professional baseball rules and allows you to control all of the players on the team. You can throw a variety of pitches (from curve balls to fast balls), steal bases, tag players out, bunt, try for a home run, and in the event of a tie the game goes into extra innings! Several difficulty levels are available which control the game speed and whether or not stealing bases is allowed.",

      "Description": "You're a microsurgeon, and your patient is in critical condition! First you need to examine the patient's medical chart to find out what's wrong, and which conditions are the most critical. Now to save the patient, you control a robot probe which can be used to administer aspirin, antiseptic, or ultrasonics to clear up the problem. You should clear up the most critical conditions first, then move on to the less serious areas to ensure your patient survives. Your probe should navigate through the veins, arteries, and lymph; if you guide the probe outside these areas, it's movement will slow down and swarms of white blood cells will attack it, depleting the limited energy supply. There are 197 different patients you need to help, each with different ailments.\n\nMicrosurgeon was among 240 video games selected to be included in \"The Art of Video Games\" exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution in 2012.",

Apple II and IBM PC versions were published in 1983.\n\nRobots, bats, and spiders chase you around a maze in Night Stalker, which boasts similar gameplay, if some what slower, to the arcade smash Berzerk. Players must pick up a gun that is randomly placed in the maze. The gun provides the player with a certain number of shots. Once depleted, the gun is again placed in a random part of the maze.",

      "Storyline": "The player controls a man trapped in a hedgerow maze with no exits and many threats, some natural such as bats and spiders, others artificial and more deadly in nature such as robots. The player starts out in a bunker in the middle of the map completely defenseless. A gun icon flashes at one of five random locations which he must pick up to arm himself. Each gun has six bullets. Once the ammunition has been exhausted, the gun icon will appear again and the player must move defenselessly through the maze to retrieve the new weapon.\n\nThere are five different robots that the man encounters in accordance with the point total. The terrain is filled with corners and ambush points that players must use to full effect. There is also a spider web in the northwest corner where the spider enemy spawns. Player movement is hindered here, and all firepower is heavily suppressed within, making it a strategic location. Also of importance is the player's bunker, in which the player begins each life. The bunker is a safe zone and the player is impervious to damage while inside, though the more advanced robot adversaries have the firepower to destroy this safe haven.",

Each city has a bubble shield that can sustain one hit; another hit to an unshielded city will destroy it.\n\nPlayers control a ship that can fire lasers horizontally and drop bomb vertically. The ship is also equipped with an energy beam that can absorb energy from energy tanks, and can also use that energy to create temporary shields around unprotected cities. The ship can also sustain up to ten blows in each round. If all four cities are destroyed or the ship takes ten hits in a round, the game ends.\n\nNova Blast is a single player game with three difficulty levels.",

You begin the game with five balls, and need to score as many points as possible by hitting the ball into the various bumpers and targets on the pinball table. The pinball table consists of three different screens, each with a different layout and level of difficulty. To advance from one screen to the next, you need to use a single ball to hit several targets and then get the ball into a white cup that appears. If you are on the second or third screen and the ball falls off the bottom, you will be back to the lower screen; if the ball falls off the bottom screen you will lose that ball. The game ends when all five balls have been lost.",

      "Storyline": "The player must maneuver a character (Pitfall Harry) through a maze-like jungle in an attempt to recover 32 treasures in a 20-minute time period. Along the way, he must negotiate numerous hazards, including pits, quicksand, rolling logs, fire, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and crocodiles. Harry may jump over or otherwise avoid these obstacles by climbing, running, or swinging on vines. Treasure includes gold and silver bars, diamond rings, and bags of money. Under the jungle there is a tunnel which Harry can access through ladders found at various points. Travelling though the tunnel moves forward three screens at a time, which is necessary in order to collect all the treasures within the time limit. However, the tunnels are filled with dead-ends blocked by brick walls, forcing the player to return to the surface at one of the ladders, and try to find a way around again, thus wasting time. The tunnels also contain scorpions, which can harm Harry.",

When the board becomes completely filled up, whomever has the most pieces of his own color on the board wins. The game can be played by two players, or one player against the computer. There are three skill levels the computer can use, and three different board sizes are available, 6 by 6, 8 by 8, and 10 by 10.",

An ever-changing, ever-challenging waterway. Expect huge islands, narrow channels and treacherous bays crawling with enemy choppers, tankers and jets. Weaponry: Code Name StratoStrafer. Your B1 StratoWing Assault Jet has been retrofitted with sophisticated, rapid-fire guided missiles. Your craft is super-sensitive to the stick. Accelerate, slow or bank radically with only a touch. Tactics: Jet low to the river to avoid radar. Stop periodically at depots to refuel. A warning claxxon will alert you. Top speed! Best of luck!",

You can shoot the cars if you like, but this will bring the Secret Police and their bullets. You should make your way to one of the embassies, where you can learn the combination needed to open the treasury vault. This is also where you can find most of the secretive items. After picking the combination locks of four embassies, you will have both secret numbers needed to open the treasury safe, which contains the gold.\n\nThe most profitable way to crack a safe is to pick its combination numbers by finding the right number sequences. This involves cycling through various numbers (0 through 99) on your keypad. Pick numbers until there are no more to find. If you find yourself running out of time, you can simply blow up the safe with dynamite. However, you will not score any points, and the Secret Police will respond to an alarm that will automatically be set off.",

Each player has access to thirteen naval vessels representing eight different ship types.[2] The player may organize these ships into smaller fleets, with a maximum of three ships per fleet and four fleets active at one time. Single-ship fleets are permitted, while larger fleets may not have two ships of the same type in one fleet. When fleets are deployed, the first ship selected as part of the fleet becomes its flagship.",

There are four handicap/skill levels to choose from after selecting whether or not the player wants a one or two-player game: Amateur, Rookie, Pro, Super Pro. Essentially, changing the handicap results in changing speeds to the gameplay, from low (Amateur) to high (Super Pro). There are no teams, only Home and Visitor.\n\nEach team has three players and a goalie. The home team is tan and the visitor team is green. The player can only control one character at at time, and this character is colored lighter than the rest of the player's team. Goalies are controlled by the computer.\n\nIn late 2018, discovering that they had over 200 loose cartridges of Slap Shot: Super Pro Hockey, the Blue Sky Rangers had new boxes and overlays printed and released the remaining stock as fully boxed copies.",

It's a twisting tangle which only the swift survive. 16 game variations put you in control.\n\nTrap Games (12 variations) -- To keep your trail moving without colliding -- and to block your opponents' trails so that they are forced into collisions. Trails that collide with others, with the edge of the picture, with obstacles or themselves are eliminated.\n\nBite Games (4 variations) -- To make contact between the head of your serpent and the tail of your opponent's serpent, \"biting\" off one link with each contact. The winner is the surviving serpent.",

      "Description": "The objective of Stampede is to round up all of the cattle you encounter. To do so, the player must lasso each one in order to capture it. The player is initially only allowed to let two cattle pass; if a third one slips by, the game is over. An important caveat to this is that the player gets one extra free pass for every 1,000 points scored. So, if a player were at 2,000 points and had not yet let any cattle pass, then he or she would be allowed to let four cattle pass before the fifth one ended the game (assuming he or she did not reach 3,000). This makes it possible for an expert player to repeatedly beat the game - as after about 5,000 points or so the game essentially \"resets,\" and the same pattern is repeated.",

An overhead display allows you to strategically move your submarines in the position of your choice. There are five difficulty levels to choose from.",

Can you handle the pressure? Because the further you go, the more difficult the mission becomes. Show that you've got what it takes by maneuvering your chopper around craggy mountain peaks, through deep dark tunnels, and over tall city buildings. All while you face enemy tanks and missiles and weird sky-flying weapons. But you can fight back with high-flying, quick-thinking, fast-reaction moves. Good luck and good flying!",

Once again, the game would be in two parts, with one part assigned to Ray Kaestner and one to Rick Koenig. Ray and Rick developed some game screens using fancy new Intellivision effects, but no final name or plot for the game was agreed upon before Mattel Electronics closed. (Asked recently to describe his half of the game, Ray shrugged and replied \"He-Man ran around fighting guys.\")\n\nM Network versions were also scheduled for Atari 2600 and Colecovision, but little or no work was done on either.\n\nThe screens Ray developed for Masters of the Universe II -- He- Man fighting bad guys on a multilevel 3-D game field with moving walls -- didn't go to waste; he recycled them in the INTV Corp. release Diner, a sequel to his game BurgerTime.",

If you can manage to sink all the penguins, you move onto the next level-- where even more penguins await to be dunked.",

The quest takes the knight into three different realms of danger, each with its own challenges, and an ever changing maze which they must navigate through. The quest is broken down into these challenges:\n\nForest - The Knight must confront three dragons, each one more difficult than the last. Along the way, an enchanted bat will give him the strength to overcome the danger.\n\nCastle - The Knight must overcome six wizards, his only aid being a mouse that will generally try to avoid capture.\n\nDungeon - A randomly appearing skull is the only defense against the nine demons that make up the sinister dungeons.\n\nAlong the way, the items that the Knight will find may be of some help (or hinder) his quest to make it through the different areas. Challenge the areas again and again for the highest score possible!",

      "Description": "Tower of Doom is a single-player, Dungeons & Dragons-inspired title created exclusively for the Intellivision. Choose from 10 different character classes, each with its own strengths. 7 different quests are available for play, with the harder quests featuring randomized maps and magic item effects. After choosing the quest to embark on, players will then control their character using a top-down view of the section of the dungeon they are in, the corridors and rooms being drawn on-screen as they explore them. Also to the player's disposal is a display of the character's inventory which can be utilized at any time, and an on-screen map of the entire dungeon. Encountering a creature will initiate a battle screen at which time players can fight the creature or attempt to bribe it with items they have discovered. Magic items and traps can also be found in the dungeon, each having unique effects on the player.",

Now Clarence needs to rescue Doris by chasing the Beach Bruiser all over the island! The Beach Bruiser will be carrying Doris to the right and the screen scrolls to follow. You need guide Clarence and catch up to Doris. There are many obstacles on the screen which temporarily slow down your progress. Coconuts, ferns, clams, sand snakes, and lava will all appear in your way. If you get slowed down too much and hit the left side of the screen, you lose one of your lives. From time to time, Doris will drop a handkerchief; collect this and you become temporarily invincible! If you catch Doris, you then move on to the next section of the island; when each section of the island has been completed you then need to battle the Beach Bruiser on a bridge. If you're successful, the game will then repeat at a more difficult skill level.",

Taking on the role of an explorer grave robbing Tutankhamun's tomb, the player is chased by creatures such as asps, vultures, parrots, bats, dragons, and even curses, all that kill the player on contact. The explorer can fight back by firing lasers at the creatures, but he can only cover the left and right directions. The player is also endowed with a single screen-clearing \"flash bomb\" per level or life. Finally, each level has warp zones that teleport the player around the level, which enemies cannot use.\n\nTo progress, the player collects keys open locked doors throughout the levels, searching for the large exit door. Optional treasures can be picked-up for bonus points. Each level has a timer; when it reaches zero the explorer can no longer fire lasers, and once a level is cleared the remaining time is converted to bonus points.",

After entering one of the rooms you are able to fight the various monsters lurking in the rooms while you collect the treasure. Be careful not to linger to long in the treasure rooms because an \"Evil Otto\" like monster will appear which is invincible and will hunt you down until you leave the room again. After having collected every treasure in every room of a dungeon you move on to the next dungeon.",

      "Description": "Word Fun was developed in conjuction with the Children's Television Workshop, and features three different word based educational games. The games are:\n\nCrosswords:\nThis game is similar to Scrabble. Each player is given seven letters from which they need to form words on the game board. On each turn the player can create words either horizontally or vertically, and must use one (or more) of the existing letters on the board. Points are earned depending on the word created, and at the end of 20 turns the player with the most points wins!\n\nLetter Hunt:\nIn this game each player controls a monkey in a letter forest. Each monkey must collect letters from the forest to spell three words within the given time limit. When both monkeys are complete, points are awarded for the words spelled and the highest score wins!\n\nWord Rockets:\nIn this game the players control a rocket capable of collecting and shooting vowels upwards. On the top of the screen, various words which are missing vowels will float by and each player needs to try to fire an appropriate vowel into the empty space. The first player who can complete 50 words wins!",

      "Description": "You're the home team in blue, engaged in the most realistic home video baseball game around. You've got to hit the fast-breaking curve balls or smoking fastballs. But don't pop up, this game features fly balls as well a grounders. You can also steal bases and kick up a cloud of dust as you slide into the bag. Nine innings of action-packed fun, for one or two players. Play ball! \n \nDuring 1981, APh started work on Baseball II and Basketball II -- one-player versions of the original games. These were not high priorities since the original versions continued to sell well. In 1982, when the Keyboard Component was killed, Marketing wanted to produce a series of Super Sports cartridges for the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) to help push that system, so work was ordered halted on the non-ECS sports games. \n \nFUN FACT: INTV Corporation released the game as is, including the fatal bug and the debugging module. The game occasionally crashes, displaying the debugging screen. To explain this, INTV added the following notice to the instruction book: \n \nBaseball II, however, was a favorite of baseball-fanatic Mike Minkoff (Snafu). The game had been essentially completed, but regularly crashed, despite weeks of debugging at APh. Mattel didn't want to put any more resources into the game, but Mike, although now a Director in charge of Intellivision, Aquarius and M Network development, volunteered to debug the game himself after hours. Since the game had already been announced in several catalogs and press releases (as All-Star Major League Baseball), Mattel kept the title on the schedule and let Mike work on it, on and off as he had time, throughout 1983. \n \nMike managed to clean most of the bugs out of the game, but the cause of one occasional crash eluded him. He linked in a debugging module written by Rick Koenig (Motocross) that displayed the contents of registers and status words on screen when a game halted. Mike was still trying to trace the problem when, in January 1984, Mattel Electronics was closed. \n \nINTV Corporation ultimately released the game; it first appears in their Spring 1986 catalog. They were able to use packaging and instructions already completed for the game at Mattel, with the change of the name to World Championship Baseball so that they wouldn't have to pay for the Major League trademark. The title screen, however, still says \"Mattel Electronics presents All-Star Major League Baseball.\"",

But due to his laziness, all of the bugs have now arrived and are trying to eat every last bit of corn! You control Felton who is armed with a spray gun. Your crop of corn is displayed on the left side of the screen, and you need to protect it from the incoming hoard of inchworms, moths, caterpillars, slugs, and other assorted bugs which approach rapidly from the right. If any of the bugs sneak past you, they will eat part of your corn crop. The game ends when all of the corn has been eaten. On each level you need to spray all of the bugs that appear in order to move on to the next round; as the rounds progress, the bugs become faster, more numerous, and home in quicker on the corn.",
